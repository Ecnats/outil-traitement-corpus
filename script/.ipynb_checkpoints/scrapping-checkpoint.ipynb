      "     \n",
      "            About 107,500 people died from a drug overdose in 2023, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâs National Center for Health Statistics â about 3,500 fewer than in 2022.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Last yearâs decrease is the first since 2018, but the 3% drop is far less substantial than the surges that pushed overdose deaths to record levels in recent years. Overdose deathsÂ spikedÂ 30% between 2019 and 2020 and rose another 15% between 2020 and 2021, CDC data shows.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Preliminary data is subject to change as death certificates are reviewed and records are assessed, but estimates suggest that, despite the decline, overdose deaths in 2023 were still almost twice as high as they were five years ago, according to the CDC data.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIt is a hopeful trend in some ways,â said Dr. Katherine Keyes, a professor at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health whose research focuses on substance use epidemiology. âWe know that this drug epidemic is dynamic and changes quite quickly, so any time you see a leveling off or a slight decrease, it is promising. It is certainly not a sign that we need to take the foot off the gas of overdose prevention.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The US Department of Health and Human Services launched a coordinated national strategy to prevent overdoses two years ago.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThis progress over the last 12 months should make us want to reinvigorate our efforts knowing that our strategies are making a difference,â CDC Chief Medical Officer Dr. Deb HouryÂ said in a statement, but âthere are still families and friends losing their loved ones to drug overdoses at staggering numbers.â\n",
      "     \n",

      "            Fentanyl has been driving the latest wave of overdose deaths, with synthetic opioids involved in more than two-thirds of overdose deaths. These highly potent narcotics continue to play an outsized role: they were involved in nearly 70% of overdose deaths in 2023. However, there were about 1,500 fewer overdose deaths involving fentanyl and other synthetic opioids in 2023 than in 2022, the new data shows.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Still, the deadly threat of fentanyl â which is about 50 times more potent than heroin â remains. In one indicator of its pervasiveness, a study published Monday shows that law enforcement seizures of illicit fentanyl have surged in recent years.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            More than 115 million pills containing illicit fentanyl were seized by law enforcement in 2023, compared with about 71 million in 2022 and less than 50,000 in 2017.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âFentanyl has continued to infiltrate the drug supply in communities across the United States and it is a very dangerous time to use drugs, even just occasionally,â Dr. Nora Volkow, director of National Institute on Drug Abuse, said in a statement. She was not directly involved in the new study, but the research was funded by the federal agency. âIllicit pills are made to look identical to real prescription pills, but can actually contain fentanyl. It is urgently important that people know that any pills given to someone by a friend, purchased on social media, or received from any source other than a pharmacy could be potentially deadly â even after a single ingestion.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The number of deaths due to fentanyl remains âalarmingly high,â Keyes said. But the more promising trends reflect significant, multi-pronged efforts from many different sectors, she said, including use of treatments for opioid use disorder, expanded access to naloxone and other harm reduction programs and reducing opioid prescribing.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âI think that has been a real success story for public health,â she said.\n",
      "     \n",

      "     \n",
      "            There were more than 36,000 deaths involving psychostimulants in 2023, a 2% increase from the year before. And deaths involving cocaine rose 5%, to nearly 30,000. About a third of all overdose deaths in 2023 involved psychostimulants, and cocaine was involved in more than a quarter.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Much of this increase is likely due to the proliferation of fentanyl throughout the drug supply, Keyes said. âWe know that when stimulants mix with opioids, itâs particularly lethal,â she said. But expanded surveillance can help those who are working to address the overdose crisis understand its rapidly changing epidemiology and adapt their efforts in real-time.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Vast disparities in overdose deaths remain, including state-level differences; the latest CDC data shows ânotableâ increases in some Western states such as Washington and Oregon, with overdose deaths increasing at least 27% year-over-year. In other states, including Nebraska, Kansas, Indiana and Maine, overdose deaths dropped by at least 15%.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âState-to-state differences point to the need for continued expansion of these efforts,â Keyes said. âBut I think the trends you see nationally are indicative of how it can work. We can address the opioid epidemic. This is not inevitable.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            For many state and local governments, funds from opioid settlements have been âinstrumentalâ to overdose prevention efforts and increased access to treatment and recovery support, Dr. Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health said in a statement.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âMoving forward, jurisdictions will continue to prioritize investments in harm reduction, prevention, and addressing the social determinants of health across communities that have been hardest hit by the overdose crisis,â he said. âAlso, state and territorial health agencies will continue to coordinate with partners to build a comprehensive response to this complex public health issue. Lastly, jurisdictions will continue to monitor and prepare to respond to changes in overdose rates and emerging threats within the drug supply.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Recent surveys suggest that drug use among teens in the US has been relatively low and trending down. But overdose deaths have been rising in this age group and millions of adults and adolescents have a drug use disorder.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âResearch has shown that delaying the start of substance use among young people, even by one year, can decrease substance use for the rest of their lives. We may be seeing this play out in real time,â Volkow said. âThis trend is reassuring. Though, it remains crucial to continue to educate young people about the risks and harms of substance use in an open and honest way, emphasizing that illicit pills and other substances may contain deadly fentanyl.â\n",

      "            After decades of decline, accidental drowning rates are rising in the US, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported. With Americans getting ready to hit swimming pools and beaches on Memorial Day weekend, a new study shows that many lack the skills they need to stay safe in the water.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Roughly 15% of US adults â 40 million people â say they donât know how to swim.Â More than half of adults have never taken a swimming lesson, according to a new national survey by the CDC. The new data on swimming skills in the US population is included in a Vital Signs report released Tuesday by the CDC.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            It comes on the heels of an increase in drowning deaths in the US in the years following the Covid-19 pandemic.Â Each year, on average, about 4,000 Americans died from accidental drowning, a number that changed little from 2011 to 2020.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            But that number has been about 10% higher the past few years, adding 500 to 600 more deaths each year to the annual tally.Â Itâs the first uptick in drowning rates in the US for at leastÂ two decades.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âWhen I just look at the overall numbers, with over 4,000 people dying â thatâs over 12 people a day â thatâs really one person every two hours. And those are lives, not numbers,â said Dr. Debra Houry, chief medical officer for the CDC.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The increases in drownings were even more dramatic for certain ages and racial groups.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Drowning has long been the leading cause of death for preschool-age children. Drowning rates increased almost 30% in this age group in 2021 and 2022. Although the number of drowning deaths in children ages 4 and younger increased among young children in 2020, the rate increase was not statistically significant that year.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Black people also saw drowning rates increase faster than the general population; compared with 2019, they were nearly 30% higher in 2021.Â Thatâs despite the fact that Black Americans reported spending less recreational time in the water than White and Hispanic people.Â If drowning rates were calculated based on exposure rather than population, the study authors noted, itâs likely that the disparities for Black people would be even more pronounced.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Additionally, the CDCâs swimming skills survey found that 1 in 3 Black adults said they couldnât swim, compared with 1 in 7 adults in the general population, a legacy of segregation and discrimination in access to swimming pools in the US, according to the CDC.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Hispanic Americans, a group that doesnât traditionally have disproportionately higher drowning rates compared with White non-Hispanics, also saw drowning rates increase by nearly 25% in 2022, compared with 2019.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            American Indian and Alaska Natives continued to have the highest rates of drownings of any racial or ethnic group overall. In 2019, there were about 3 drowning deaths for every 100,000 people among American Indian and Alaska Natives, a rate that has seen little change over the course of the pandemic.Â By comparison, there were 1.2 accidental drowning deaths for every 100,000 among White people in 2019.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Houry says itâs hard to say exactly how the pandemic may have played a role in the increases.Â The study can only make associations â it canât untangle the causes â but she notes that it was harder to get into public pools, with many closing or implementing policies that limited access.Â Staffing was also problematic for many swim venues.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThere would have been people, if swimming pools were closed for that year, who didnât get swim lessons and so might have been behind in getting swim lessons,â Houry said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Berkeley Champlin didnât know the statistics around drowning deaths in young children until her son, Gordie, tragically became one of them.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In July 2020, 3-year-old Gordie slipped unnoticed out of the sliding glass doors in Champlinâs home in Livonia, Michigan, while Champlin was at work. Normally, he would have been in day care, but like many schools, it was shut down at the time.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            His father, who was home with him, later found him in the familyâs pool. He couldnât be revived.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Gordie loved animals and couldnât go to sleep at night without special stuffed animals: an elephant and a bunny.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âI put his elephant and his bunny in his casket with him so that he has them always, because heâs sleeping,â Champlin said.Â She has drawings of the stuffies tattooed on her forearm.\n",
      "     \n",

      "            After decades of decline, accidental drowning rates are rising in the US, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported. With Americans getting ready to hit swimming pools and beaches on Memorial Day weekend, a new study shows that many lack the skills they need to stay safe in the water.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Roughly 15% of US adults â 40 million people â say they donât know how to swim.Â More than half of adults have never taken a swimming lesson, according to a new national survey by the CDC. The new data on swimming skills in the US population is included in a Vital Signs report released Tuesday by the CDC.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            It comes on the heels of an increase in drowning deaths in the US in the years following the Covid-19 pandemic.Â Each year, on average, about 4,000 Americans died from accidental drowning, a number that changed little from 2011 to 2020.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            But that number has been about 10% higher the past few years, adding 500 to 600 more deaths each year to the annual tally.Â Itâs the first uptick in drowning rates in the US for at leastÂ two decades.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âWhen I just look at the overall numbers, with over 4,000 people dying â thatâs over 12 people a day â thatâs really one person every two hours. And those are lives, not numbers,â said Dr. Debra Houry, chief medical officer for the CDC.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The increases in drownings were even more dramatic for certain ages and racial groups.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Drowning has long been the leading cause of death for preschool-age children. Drowning rates increased almost 30% in this age group in 2021 and 2022. Although the number of drowning deaths in children ages 4 and younger increased among young children in 2020, the rate increase was not statistically significant that year.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Black people also saw drowning rates increase faster than the general population; compared with 2019, they were nearly 30% higher in 2021.Â Thatâs despite the fact that Black Americans reported spending less recreational time in the water than White and Hispanic people.Â If drowning rates were calculated based on exposure rather than population, the study authors noted, itâs likely that the disparities for Black people would be even more pronounced.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Additionally, the CDCâs swimming skills survey found that 1 in 3 Black adults said they couldnât swim, compared with 1 in 7 adults in the general population, a legacy of segregation and discrimination in access to swimming pools in the US, according to the CDC.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Hispanic Americans, a group that doesnât traditionally have disproportionately higher drowning rates compared with White non-Hispanics, also saw drowning rates increase by nearly 25% in 2022, compared with 2019.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            American Indian and Alaska Natives continued to have the highest rates of drownings of any racial or ethnic group overall. In 2019, there were about 3 drowning deaths for every 100,000 people among American Indian and Alaska Natives, a rate that has seen little change over the course of the pandemic.Â By comparison, there were 1.2 accidental drowning deaths for every 100,000 among White people in 2019.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Houry says itâs hard to say exactly how the pandemic may have played a role in the increases.Â The study can only make associations â it canât untangle the causes â but she notes that it was harder to get into public pools, with many closing or implementing policies that limited access.Â Staffing was also problematic for many swim venues.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThere would have been people, if swimming pools were closed for that year, who didnât get swim lessons and so might have been behind in getting swim lessons,â Houry said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Berkeley Champlin didnât know the statistics around drowning deaths in young children until her son, Gordie, tragically became one of them.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In July 2020, 3-year-old Gordie slipped unnoticed out of the sliding glass doors in Champlinâs home in Livonia, Michigan, while Champlin was at work. Normally, he would have been in day care, but like many schools, it was shut down at the time.\n",
      "     \n",

      "            New analyses of the longest clinical trial yet of the weight-loss drug Wegovy are shedding light on how quickly it helps people lose weight, how long they sustain that weight loss and how safe the medicine is over four years of use.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The analyses â of a trial called Select, whose results showed last year that Wegovy significantly reduced heart risk in addition to helping with weight loss â also suggest that the drug may protect the heart in ways beyond weight loss alone, researchers said, raising new questions about how the wildly popular medicines in this drug class should be used â and covered by insurers.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThe implications are profound,â said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist and scientist at Yale University and Yale New Haven Hospital who was not involved in the research, noting that a second study this week showed a similar finding for heart failure. âWe have not encountered a drug with such a breadth of heart benefits.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            More than 25,000 people in the US are starting Wegovy every week, drugmaker Novo Nordisk said this month. And in a KFF poll released Friday, 6% of respondents said they were currently using a drug in this class, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists. That translates to more than 15 million Americans.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            One important question about these blockbuster medicines is how widely â and how long â theyâve been studied. The Select trial, which was funded by Novo Nordisk, showed last year that Wegovy reduced the risk of a heart attack, stroke or heart-related death by 20% in people with existing cardiovascular risk with obesity or who are overweight. It included more than 17,600 people from 41 countries between 2018 and 2021 and followed them for several years.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Researchers have continued to mine the data, and the new analyses, presented Monday at the European Congress on Obesity and published in the journal Nature Medicine, show results for people taking Wegovy as long as four years. Here are some major takeaways:\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The analysis showed an average weight loss of just over 10% for people who used semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, compared with 1.5% for study participants who got a placebo. The researchers, led by Dr. Donna Ryan of Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, noted that the trend showed that participants on the medication typically lost weight for about 65 weeks, or a year and three months, before reaching a plateau.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            A previous clinical trial showed even greater average weight loss for Wegovy: about 15% on average over 68 weeks, compared with 2.4% for people who got a placebo. The researchers on the new analysis noted that, in addition to some differences in the people who enrolled in each trial, the previous study was designed specifically for weight loss and included more structured lifestyle interventions about diet and exercise compared with the Select trial, which was designed to test whether the drug prevented cardiac events.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The results showed that the 10% average weight loss for people using Wegovy was sustained for up to 208 weeks, or four years.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Patients stayed on the medicine while they sustained the weight loss. Other studies have shown that many people regain weight after stopping the drugs, including one published in December from Novo Nordisk competitor Eli Lilly: People using the GLP-1 drug Zepbound, which uses the active ingredient tirzepatide and targets a second hormone called GIP, lost an average of 21% of their body weight over 36 weeks. The participants were then split into two groups, and those who stayed on the medicine lost an additional 5.5% of their body weight, while those who unknowingly switched to a placebo regained 14% of their weight.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            However, not everybody regained so much weight. The study also looked at how many people maintained at least 80% of the weight loss after the initial 36 weeks, and while many more who continued on the drug did â almost 90% - almost 17% of people who were switched to a placebo maintained that much weight loss without the drug.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In the new analysis, the researchers reported that after two years, about 68% of people taking Wegovy had lost at least 5% of their body weight, while 21% of people on a placebo did. Almost 23% of people on Wegovy lost at least 15% of their body weight, compared with 1.7% on a placebo. And almost 5% of people on the drug lost more than 25% of their body weight, compared with 0.1% on placebo, showing that the top-line findings from studies are just averages; everyone has a different experience with medicines.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Overall, more people on Wegovy decided to stop participating in the trial because of side effects than people who got a placebo: 17% of those on the drug versus 8% on placebo, a result that was previously reported. And the side effects were ones that are widely known with these medicines: mainly gastrointestinal disorders like nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation, which usually affected people in the first few months of the study as the dose of the medicine increased.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The researchers noted that there were no new safety signals seen in the latest analyses. Acute pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, wasnât seen at a higher rate among those on Wegovy than placebo, although gallbladder disorders like gallstones were: 2.8% for people on Wegovy, compared with 2.3% for people on placebo. Both are included in warnings in the drugâs prescribing information because theyâd been seen previously in trials.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            A key question when the full results of the Select trial were initially presented was whether the 20% reduction in heart risk was driven by weight-loss alone or some other protective effect of the drug. The new analysis suggests that there is something else at play.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Thatâs because the reduction in risk of heart attack or other events was seen even in people using Wegovy who didnât lose weight.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âYou probably donât even need to lose weight to get the cardiovascular benefitâ with semaglutide and similar medicines, said Dr. Daniel Drucker, a pioneer of research into GLP-1 at the University of Toronto who wasnât involved in the new analyses. âThatâs because thatâs what GLP-1 does: Itâs cardio-protective, at least in animals, independent of whether or not you have diabetes, independent of whether you have obesity, and you donât require weight loss â itâs not the whole story.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            An analysis led by John Deanfield of University College London found that the reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in the study for those on Wegovy, compared with placebo, was similar among people who lost 5% or more of their body weight and those who lost less than that or even those who gained weight.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThis suggests alternative mechanisms of improved cardiovascular outcome beyond reduction in adiposity,â or body fat, the researchers concluded.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            A separate study published Monday about heart failure, for which Wegovy has shown a major benefit, suggested the same thing, Krumholz said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThese two studies show that these anti-obesity medications are also heart-health drugs,â he wrote in an email. âThe benefits to the heart for people with established cardiovascular disease or a certain type of heart failure occur regardless of the amount of weight loss.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Drucker suspects that GLP-1 drugs provide these kinds of benefits by reducing inflammation.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âWe canât ignore the reduction in blood pressure or triglycerides, and the reduction in body weight must help a little bit, and glucose must help a little as well,â he said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            But based on his labâs research, he said, âone of my favorite theories is inflammation, because we know that people with cardiovascular disease do have increased inflammation in their blood vessels and in the heart.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Drucker said studies have shown that GLP-1 drugs tamp down harmful inflammation, which his lab is studying. He even noted that he receives communications from people with conditions like Covid-related brain fog, ulcerative colitis and arthritis â driven by inflammation â who think their symptoms have improved while using GLP-1 medicines. Those links would need to be borne out in clinical studies to be considered definitive.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The results in the Select trial, he said, raise the question of whether people who donât have obesity or arenât overweight but who have had a heart attack or stroke could benefit from taking a drug like Wegovy to prevent another event â another thing that would need to be studied.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            And, Drucker said, the results suggest that insurers should cover the medicines, which cost about $1,000 per month or more without it, more widely.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âWe probably really need to rethink these criteria for reimbursing the medicines, because they are going to be helpful in terms of actually improvingÂ healthÂ and saving lives and savingÂ healthÂ care dollars in people with obesity and heart disease even without much weight loss,â he said. âYou donât even need to lose weight to have a reduction in heart attack, strokes andÂ death.â\n",

      "     \n",
      "            Researchers have continued to mine the data, and the new analyses, presented Monday at the European Congress on Obesity and published in the journal Nature Medicine, show results for people taking Wegovy as long as four years. Here are some major takeaways:\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The analysis showed an average weight loss of just over 10% for people who used semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy, compared with 1.5% for study participants who got a placebo. The researchers, led by Dr. Donna Ryan of Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, noted that the trend showed that participants on the medication typically lost weight for about 65 weeks, or a year and three months, before reaching a plateau.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            A previous clinical trial showed even greater average weight loss for Wegovy: about 15% on average over 68 weeks, compared with 2.4% for people who got a placebo. The researchers on the new analysis noted that, in addition to some differences in the people who enrolled in each trial, the previous study was designed specifically for weight loss and included more structured lifestyle interventions about diet and exercise compared with the Select trial, which was designed to test whether the drug prevented cardiac events.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The results showed that the 10% average weight loss for people using Wegovy was sustained for up to 208 weeks, or four years.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Patients stayed on the medicine while they sustained the weight loss. Other studies have shown that many people regain weight after stopping the drugs, including one published in December from Novo Nordisk competitor Eli Lilly: People using the GLP-1 drug Zepbound, which uses the active ingredient tirzepatide and targets a second hormone called GIP, lost an average of 21% of their body weight over 36 weeks. The participants were then split into two groups, and those who stayed on the medicine lost an additional 5.5% of their body weight, while those who unknowingly switched to a placebo regained 14% of their weight.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            However, not everybody regained so much weight. The study also looked at how many people maintained at least 80% of the weight loss after the initial 36 weeks, and while many more who continued on the drug did â almost 90% - almost 17% of people who were switched to a placebo maintained that much weight loss without the drug.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In the new analysis, the researchers reported that after two years, about 68% of people taking Wegovy had lost at least 5% of their body weight, while 21% of people on a placebo did. Almost 23% of people on Wegovy lost at least 15% of their body weight, compared with 1.7% on a placebo. And almost 5% of people on the drug lost more than 25% of their body weight, compared with 0.1% on placebo, showing that the top-line findings from studies are just averages; everyone has a different experience with medicines.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Overall, more people on Wegovy decided to stop participating in the trial because of side effects than people who got a placebo: 17% of those on the drug versus 8% on placebo, a result that was previously reported. And the side effects were ones that are widely known with these medicines: mainly gastrointestinal disorders like nausea, diarrhea, vomiting and constipation, which usually affected people in the first few months of the study as the dose of the medicine increased.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The researchers noted that there were no new safety signals seen in the latest analyses. Acute pancreatitis, or inflammation of the pancreas, wasnât seen at a higher rate among those on Wegovy than placebo, although gallbladder disorders like gallstones were: 2.8% for people on Wegovy, compared with 2.3% for people on placebo. Both are included in warnings in the drugâs prescribing information because theyâd been seen previously in trials.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            A key question when the full results of the Select trial were initially presented was whether the 20% reduction in heart risk was driven by weight-loss alone or some other protective effect of the drug. The new analysis suggests that there is something else at play.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Thatâs because the reduction in risk of heart attack or other events was seen even in people using Wegovy who didnât lose weight.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âYou probably donât even need to lose weight to get the cardiovascular benefitâ with semaglutide and similar medicines, said Dr. Daniel Drucker, a pioneer of research into GLP-1 at the University of Toronto who wasnât involved in the new analyses. âThatâs because thatâs what GLP-1 does: Itâs cardio-protective, at least in animals, independent of whether or not you have diabetes, independent of whether you have obesity, and you donât require weight loss â itâs not the whole story.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            An analysis led by John Deanfield of University College London found that the reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events in the study for those on Wegovy, compared with placebo, was similar among people who lost 5% or more of their body weight and those who lost less than that or even those who gained weight.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThis suggests alternative mechanisms of improved cardiovascular outcome beyond reduction in adiposity,â or body fat, the researchers concluded.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            A separate study published Monday about heart failure, for which Wegovy has shown a major benefit, suggested the same thing, Krumholz said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThese two studies show that these anti-obesity medications are also heart-health drugs,â he wrote in an email. âThe benefits to the heart for people with established cardiovascular disease or a certain type of heart failure occur regardless of the amount of weight loss.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Drucker suspects that GLP-1 drugs provide these kinds of benefits by reducing inflammation.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âWe canât ignore the reduction in blood pressure or triglycerides, and the reduction in body weight must help a little bit, and glucose must help a little as well,â he said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            But based on his labâs research, he said, âone of my favorite theories is inflammation, because we know that people with cardiovascular disease do have increased inflammation in their blood vessels and in the heart.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Drucker said studies have shown that GLP-1 drugs tamp down harmful inflammation, which his lab is studying. He even noted that he receives communications from people with conditions like Covid-related brain fog, ulcerative colitis and arthritis â driven by inflammation â who think their symptoms have improved while using GLP-1 medicines. Those links would need to be borne out in clinical studies to be considered definitive.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The results in the Select trial, he said, raise the question of whether people who donât have obesity or arenât overweight but who have had a heart attack or stroke could benefit from taking a drug like Wegovy to prevent another event â another thing that would need to be studied.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            And, Drucker said, the results suggest that insurers should cover the medicines, which cost about $1,000 per month or more without it, more widely.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âWe probably really need to rethink these criteria for reimbursing the medicines, because they are going to be helpful in terms of actually improvingÂ healthÂ and saving lives and savingÂ healthÂ care dollars in people with obesity and heart disease even without much weight loss,â he said. âYou donât even need to lose weight to have a reduction in heart attack, strokes andÂ death.â\n",

      "            Nearly three months after the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade shooting left at least 24 people injured, recovery from those wounds is intensely personal and includes a surprising gray area in medicine: whether the bullets should be removed.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Medical protocol offers no clear answer. A 2016 survey of surgeons found thatÂ only about 15%Â of respondents worked at medical facilities that had policies on bullet removal.

The warehouse worker was carrying his 5-year-old daughter, Kensley, on his shoulders when he felt a bullet enter the back of his right thigh.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Gunfire erupted in the area packed with revelers,Â prosecutors later said, after a âverbal confrontationâ between two groups. Detectives found âmultiple 9mm and .40 caliber spent shell casingsâ at the scene. Lemons said he understood immediately what was happening.\n",

      "     \n",

      "     \n",
      "            âSheâs like: âIâm getting you to a hospital. Iâm tired of people being in my way,ââ Lemons recalled. âIâve never seen my wife like that. Iâm looking at her like, âThatâs kinda sexy.ââ\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Lemons clapped and smiled at his wife, he said, to which she replied, âWhat are you smiling for? You just got shot.â He stayed in quiet admiration until they were stopped by a sheriff, who summoned an ambulance, Lemons said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            He was taken to the emergency room at University Health, whichÂ admitted 12 patientsÂ from the rally, including eight with gunshot wounds.

      "     \n",
      "            âI get it, but I donât like that,â Lemons said. âWhy wouldnât you take it out if you could?â\n",

      "     \n",
      "            Surgeons typically do remove bullets when they encounter them during surgery or they are in dangerous locations, like in the spinal canal or risking damage to an organ, saidÂ Brendan Campbell, a pediatric surgeon at Connecticut Childrenâs.\n",

      "     \n",
      "            In the survey of surgeons, the most common reasons given for removing a bullet were pain, a palpable bullet lodged near the skin, or an infection. Far less common were lead poisoning and mental health concerns such as post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            What patients wanted also affected their decisions, the surgeons said.\n",

      "     \n",
      "            The most frustrating consequence is that she cannot travel to see her 102-year-old father, still in Mexico. She has a live camera feed on her phone to see him, but that doesnât offer much comfort, she said, and thinking about him brings tears.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            She was told at the hospital that her medical bills would be taken care of, but then lots of them came in the mail.

      "     \n",
      "            The bullet grazed Mireyaâs chin, shot through her jaw, broke her shoulder, and left through her arm. Bullet fragments remain in her shoulder. Doctors decided to leave them because Mireya had already suffered so much damage.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Mireyaâs mother supports that decision, for now, noting they were just âfragments.â\n",

      "            Bullet fragments, particularly ones only skin-deep, often push their way out like splinters, according to Punch, although patients arenât always told about that. Moreover, Punch said, injuries caused by bullets extend beyond those with damaged tissue to the people around them, like Erika. He called for a holistic approach to recover from all the trauma.\n",

      "     \n",
      "            Campbell, the pediatric surgeon, said lead is particularly concerning for young children, whose developing brains make them especially vulnerable toÂ its harmful effects.Â Even a tiny amountÂ of lead â 3.5 micrograms per deciliter â is enough to report to state health officials, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Mireya talks about cute teenage boysâ being âfineâ but also still wears Cookie Monster pajamas. She appears confused by the shootings, by all the attention at home, at school, from reporters. Asked how she feels about the fragments in her arm, she said, âI donât really care for them.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Mireya was on antibiotics for 10 days after her hospital stay because doctors feared there was bacteria in the wound. She has had physical therapy, but itâs painful to do the exercises. She has a scar on her chin. âA dent,â she said, thatâs âbumpy.â\n",
      "     \n",

      "            âLike, I wanted to keep the bullet that went through my arm,â Mireya said. âI want to know what kind of bullet it was.â That brought a sigh from her mom, who said her daughter had watched too many episodes of âForensic Files.â\n",

      "     \n",
      "            Sarai Holguin, a 71-year-old woman originally from Mexico, has accepted the bullet lodged near her knee as her âcompaâ â a close friend.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Mireya Nelson, 15, was hit by a bullet that went through her jaw and broke her shoulder, where fragments remain. Sheâll live with them for now, while doctors monitor lead levels in her blood for at least two years.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Nearly three months after the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade shooting left at least 24 people injured, recovery from those wounds is intensely personal and includes a surprising gray area in medicine: whether the bullets should be removed.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Medical protocol offers no clear answer. A 2016 survey of surgeons found thatÂ only about 15%Â of respondents worked at medical facilities that had policies on bullet removal. Doctors in the U.S. often leave bullets buried deep in a personâs body, at least at first, so as not to cause further trauma.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            But as gun violence has emerged as a public health epidemic,Â some researchers wonderÂ if that practice is best. Some of the wounded, like James Lemons, are left in a precarious place.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIf thereâs a way to get it out, and itâs safely taken out, get it out of the person,â Lemons said. âMake that person feel more secure about themselves. And youâre not walking around with that memory in you.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Lemons, Holguin, and Nelson are coping in very different ways.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Three days after the Chiefs won the Super Bowl, Lemons drove the 37 miles from Harrisonville, Missouri, to downtown Kansas City to celebrate the victory. The warehouse worker was carrying his 5-year-old daughter, Kensley, on his shoulders when he felt a bullet enter the back of his right thigh.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Gunfire erupted in the area packed with revelers,Â prosecutors later said, after a âverbal confrontationâ between two groups. Detectives found âmultiple 9mm and .40 caliber spent shell casingsâ at the scene. Lemons said he understood immediately what was happening.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âI know my city. Weâre not shooting off fireworks,â he said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Lemons shielded Kensleyâs face as they fell to the ground so she wouldnât hit the concrete. His first thought was getting his family â also including his wife, Brandie; 17-year-old daughter, Kallie; and 10-year-old son, Jaxson â to safety.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIâm hit. But donât worry about it,â Lemons recalled telling Brandie. âWe gotta go.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            He carried Kensley on his shoulders as the family walked a mile to their car. His leg bled through his pants at first then stopped, he said. It burned with pain. Brandie insisted on driving him to the hospital but traffic was at a standstill so she put on her hazard lights and drove on the wrong side of the road.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âSheâs like: âIâm getting you to a hospital. Iâm tired of people being in my way,ââ Lemons recalled. âIâve never seen my wife like that. Iâm looking at her like, âThatâs kinda sexy.ââ\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Lemons clapped and smiled at his wife, he said, to which she replied, âWhat are you smiling for? You just got shot.â He stayed in quiet admiration until they were stopped by a sheriff, who summoned an ambulance, Lemons said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            He was taken to the emergency room at University Health, whichÂ admitted 12 patientsÂ from the rally, including eight with gunshot wounds. Imaging showed the bullet barely missed an artery, Lemons said. Doctors cleansed the wound, put his leg in a brace, and told him to come back in a week. The bullet was still in his leg.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âI was a little baffled by it, but I was like, âOK, whatever, Iâll get out of here,ââ Lemons recalled.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            When he returned, doctors removed the brace but explained they often leave bullets and fragments in the body â unless they grow too painful.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âI get it, but I donât like that,â Lemons said. âWhy wouldnât you take it out if you could?â\n",

      "            Surgeons typically do remove bullets when they encounter them during surgery or they are in dangerous locations, like in the spinal canal or risking damage to an organ, saidÂ Brendan Campbell, a pediatric surgeon at Connecticut Childrenâs.\n",

      "            âTrauma care is war medicine,â Punch said. âIt is set to be ready at any moment and any time, every day, to save a life. It is not equipped to take care of the healing that needs to come after.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In the survey of surgeons, the most common reasons given for removing a bullet were pain, a palpable bullet lodged near the skin, or an infection. Far less common were lead poisoning and mental health concerns such as post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety.\n",

      "            Holguin was hospitalized for a week, and two more outpatient surgeries quickly followed, mostly to remove dead tissue around the wound. She wore a wound VAC, or vacuum-assisted closure device, for several weeks and had medical appointments every other day.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Campbell, the trauma surgeon, said wound VACs are common when bullets damage tissue that isnât easily reconstructed in surgery.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âItâs not just the physical injuries,â Campbell said. âMany times itâs the emotional, psychological injuries, which many of these patients take away as well.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The bullet remains near Holguinâs knee.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIâm going to have it for the rest of my life,â she said, saying she and the bullet became âcompas,â close friends.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âWe became friends so that she doesnât do any bad to me anymore,â Holguin said with a smile.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Punch, of the Bullet Related Injury Clinic in St. Louis, said some people like Holguin are able to find a way to psychically live with bullets that remain.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIf youâre able to make a story around what that means for that bullet to be in your body, that gives you power; that gives you agency and choice,â Punch said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Holguinâs life changed in an instant: Sheâs using a walker to get around. Her foot, she said, acts âlike it had a strokeâ â it dangles, and itâs difficult to move her toes.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The most frustrating consequence is that she cannot travel to see her 102-year-old father, still in Mexico. She has a live camera feed on her phone to see him, but that doesnât offer much comfort, she said, and thinking about him brings tears.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            She was told at the hospital that her medical bills would be taken care of, but then lots of them came in the mail. She tried to get victim assistance from the state of Missouri, but all the forms she had were in English, which made them difficult to comprehend. Renting the wound VAC alone cost $800 a month.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Finally she heard that the Mexican Consulate in Kansas City could help, and the consul pointed her to the Jackson County Prosecutorâs Office, with which she registered as an official victim. Now all of her bills are being paid, she said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Holguin isnât going to seek mental health treatment, as she believes one must learn to live with a given situation or it will become a burden.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âI have processed this new chapter in my life,â Holguin said. âI have never given up and I will move on with Godâs help.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Mireya Nelson was late to the parade. Her mother, Erika, told her she should leave early, given traffic and the million people expected to crowd into downtown Kansas City, but she and her teenage friends ignored that advice. The Nelsons live in Belton, Missouri, about a half hour south of the city.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Mireya wanted to hold the Super Bowl trophy. When she and her three friends arrived, the parade that had moved through downtown was over and the rally at Union Station had begun. They were stuck in the large crowd and quickly grew bored, Mireya said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Getting ready to leave, Mireya and one of her friends were trying to call the driver of their group, but they couldnât get cell service in the large crowd.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Amid the chaos of people and noise, Mireya suddenly fell.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âI saw blood on my hands. So then I knew I got shot. Yeah, and I just crawled to a tree,â Mireya said. âI actually didnât know where I got shot at, at first. I just saw blood on my hands.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The bullet grazed Mireyaâs chin, shot through her jaw, broke her shoulder, and left through her arm. Bullet fragments remain in her shoulder. Doctors decided to leave them because Mireya had already suffered so much damage.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Mireyaâs mother supports that decision, for now, noting they were just âfragments.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âI think if itâs not going to harm her the rest of her life,â Erika said, âI donât want her to keep going back in the hospital and getting surgery. Thatâs more trauma to her and more recovery time, more physical therapy and stuff like that.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Bullet fragments, particularly ones only skin-deep, often push their way out like splinters, according to Punch, although patients arenât always told about that. Moreover, Punch said, injuries caused by bullets extend beyond those with damaged tissue to the people around them, like Erika. He called for a holistic approach to recover from all the trauma.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âWhen people stay in their trauma, that trauma can change them for a lifetime,â Punch said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Mireya will be tested forÂ lead levels in her bloodÂ for at least the next two years. Her levels are fine now, doctors told the family, but if they get worse she will need surgery to remove the fragments, her mother said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Campbell, the pediatric surgeon, said lead is particularly concerning for young children, whose developing brains make them especially vulnerable toÂ its harmful effects.Â Even a tiny amountÂ of lead â 3.5 micrograms per deciliter â is enough to report to state health officials, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Mireya talks about cute teenage boysâ being âfineâ but also still wears Cookie Monster pajamas. She appears confused by the shootings, by all the attention at home, at school, from reporters. Asked how she feels about the fragments in her arm, she said, âI donât really care for them.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Mireya was on antibiotics for 10 days after her hospital stay because doctors feared there was bacteria in the wound. She has had physical therapy, but itâs painful to do the exercises. She has a scar on her chin. âA dent,â she said, thatâs âbumpy.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThey said she was lucky because if she wouldnât have turned her head in a certain way, she could be gone,â Erika said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Mireya faces a psychiatric evaluation and therapy appointments, though she doesnât like to talk about her feelings.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            So far, Erikaâs insurance is paying the medical bills, though she hopes to get some help from the United WayâsÂ #KCStrong fund, which raised nearly $1.9 million, or a faith-based organization calledÂ Unite KC.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Erika doesnât want a handout. She has a job in health care and just got a promotion.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The bullet has changed the familyâs life in big ways. It is part of their conversation now. They talk about how they wish they knew what kind of ammunition it was, or what it looked like.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âLike, I wanted to keep the bullet that went through my arm,â Mireya said. âI want to know what kind of bullet it was.â That brought a sigh from her mom, who said her daughter had watched too many episodes of âForensic Files.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Erika beats herself up about the wound, because she couldnât protect her daughter at the parade.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIt hits me hard because I feel bad because she begged me to get off work and I didnât go there because when you have a new position, you canât just take off work,â Erika said. âBecause I would have took the bullet. Because I would do anything. Itâs mom mode.â\n",

      "            Newly announced financial incentives to farms to help stem the spread of bird flu in dairy cattle drew mixed reviews Friday, as some farmers said they were grateful for money to help buffer the economic impact but advocates for farm workers questioned whether the money paid to workers would be enough to encourage more testing for the H5N1 virus.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            As part of the plan, announced Friday by the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture, the government will pay up to $28,000 per farm over the next four months to support specific steps to prevent the spread of bird flu in dairy cattle.Â About $98 million will be funneled to the USDAâs Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to fund the program.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The USDA confirmed the first bird flu infection in cows in late March.Â Since then, more than 40 herds have tested positive in nine states.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Right now, health officials say, the virus doesnât transmit efficiently from person to person, making the risk to humans low.Â But scientists have said that having the infection spreading in domesticated animals like cattle is risky because it puts the virus in closer proximity to people, where it could adapt and evolve to become a fully human pathogen.Â If that happens, researchers say, it could spark another pandemic.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âI think itâs fair to say that our top priority at USDA, given our mission, is to contain this as an animal health event,â Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said Friday. âUltimately, we want to eliminate the virus in the industry and develop over time a vaccine to prevent another emergency of H5N1 in cattle.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The USDA has acknowledged that some dairy producers have been wary of letting the government come onto their farms to test livestock. Farm workers with symptoms have also reportedly been reluctant to be tested for H5N1 influenza, since most are not compensated if they need to take time off for illness.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            As part of the plan announced Friday, the USDA willÂ provide financial support â up to $2,000 per affected farm per month â for producers who supply personal protective equipment to their workers or help them wash their uniforms.Â Financial support is also available to farmers who allow their workers to participate inÂ a study through the USDA and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Workers who participate in the CDC study would also be compensated for their time.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the CDC, said workers would get $75 for participating in an interview as well as providing a nasal swab and a blood sample, although he said they didnât have to do all three.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Advocates for farm workers said they were skeptical that the $75 payment would be enough to encourage more testing.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThere are some really significant resources that are being allocated to the owners of the cattle. But far less is being advocated to the workers who are in close contact and at high risk working in those milking parlors,â said Elizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            â$75 is not going to seem like a good gamble to someone who may be looking at much longer off of work. And $75 isnât going to feed their families,â she said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Strater estimates that there are between 150,000 and 200,000 dairy workers in the US.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThis is not a huge amount of people. But if you think about how important to protecting the public health that would be, you would think that we will be putting all of our resources into a protective ring around these folks,â she said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Strater says thereâs a real reluctance on the part of farm workers to be tested, even when they have symptoms, because a positive test could mean time off work.\n",

      "            âThe testing situation is really challenging,â said Bethany Alcauter, director of research and public health programs for the National Center for Farmworker Health.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The way we now find out about human cases of H5N1 is âa very passive system,â she said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Alcauter says public health officials assume that if someone has influenza symptoms, theyâll go to a doctor, who will take an occupational health history, and if the worker tests positive for the flu, the doctor will send that personâs swab to a state public health lab to be tested for H5N1. âBut thatâs not a very realistic scenario,â she said, noting that only a few dozen people had been tested for the H5N1 virus after exposure to cattle.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Besides payments to help assist farms in protecting their workers, payments of up to $1,500 per farm will be available to aid in the development of biosecurity plans.Â The USDA will offer dairy farms $100 to purchase a piece of equipment called an in-line sampler so their milk can be tested as it travels between cows and holding tanks.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Another $2,000 will be available to farms that heat treat their wasted milk before it is disposed.\n",

      "     \n",
      "            The government says it will also compensate farmers for lost milk production if their cows get sick.\n",

      "            A new blood test can be performed in a pregnant personâs first trimester to help assess their risk of developing preeclampsia, a potentially life-threatening pregnancy complication.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Itâs the first and only test of its kind available in the United States that can be used between 11 and 14 weeks gestation to determine the risk of preeclampsia before 34 weeks of pregnancy, its maker, Labcorp, announced Wednesday. The first trimesterÂ is the period from 0 to 13 weeks of a pregnancy.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            However, the new test doesnât change clinical guidance on preeclampsia, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, also known as ACOG. Some doctors question how it will help.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIt is currently unclear how useful the LabCorp test will be in accurately predicting risk for developing preeclampsia and whether it is appropriate for all pregnant patients,â Dr. Christopher Zahn, ACOGâs interim CEO and chief of clinical practice and health equity and quality, said in a statement.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âBefore a screening test can be successfully employed, there needs to be an evidence-based intervention to either prevent or reduce the impact of the disease. We currently have no data on how to reduce the risk for a pregnant patient predicted to have preeclampsia from a blood test early in pregnancy as opposed to clinical factors,â he added.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Preeclampsia is a complication of pregnancyÂ marked by elevated blood pressure and high levels of protein in the urine or other signs of organ damage. The condition typically develops after 20 weeksÂ of pregnancy â in the second trimester â and if left untreated, it can turn serious or deadly for both mother and baby.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            There is no cure for preeclampsia, outside of the mother delivering the baby, but some severe cases can be treated with medications like antihypertensive drugs.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Some factors that can put a pregnant person at risk of preeclampsia include being older than 35; being pregnant for the first time; having obesity; having a family history of preeclampsia; having diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney disease or an autoimmune disease; having twins or triplets; or having undergone in vitro fertilization.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The new screening test evaluates any patientâs risk of preeclampsia by 34 weeks gestation, which is the third trimester, and provides a comprehensive risk assessment with up to 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity, according to Labcorp. Sensitivity refers to the testâs ability to accurately identify pregnancies at high risk, and specificity refers to its ability to accurately identify pregnancies that are not at high risk.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Doctors who think their patients might benefit from this screening can talk to their patients about the option, order the test and get results within a few days.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThis is one more tool in the tool belt for clinicians in the US and beyond to help deliver better maternal outcomes,â said Dr. Brian Caveney, Labcorpâs chief medical and scientific officer. About 1 in 25 pregnancies in the United StatesÂ is affected by preeclampsia, and it is one of the leading causes of maternal death.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Options are limited for preeclampsia risk screening. Before the launch of the new test, at-risk patients could screen for their preeclampsia risk only during the second or third trimester of pregnancy if they were both symptomatic and hospitalized, and even that test was just launched last year.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The new first-trimester testÂ isnât a diagnostic testÂ but a risk assessment tool to determine whether someone is more likely than average to develop preeclampsia during their current pregnancy,Â âalong with all the other questions your doctor might ask you during a first-trimester visit,â Caveney said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The screening results can lead to âa whole bunch of slight changes in the prenatal care that you get from your doctor, based on the results of this risk predictor tool early on,â heÂ said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Those changes may involve having more doctor visits to monitor your pregnancy, checking your blood pressure at home at least once a week, being mindful to not overexert yourself during exercise or at work or, if recommended by your physician, taking a low-dose aspirin preventively.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends the use of a low-dose aspirin as preventive medication after 12 weeks gestation in people at high risk for preeclampsia, but some people and their providers may not know that theyâre at high risk, especially if it is their first pregnancy.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âAt least half or more of cases of preeclampsia are potentially preventable,â Caveney said. âIf you identify it earlier in the pregnancy, youâre more likely to be able to do things that lead to a healthier pregnancy and, therefore, hopefully a healthier delivery.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The new screening test is a laboratory-developed test or LDT, so it does not require approval by the US Food and Drug Administration to be performed.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Labcorp is in talks with health insurance plans to ensure that the test could be covered, Caveney said, adding that the screening assay has a list price of about $240.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The risk of preeclampsia also has racial disparities. In the United States, the rate in Black women is about 60% higher than in White women. In general, Black women are three times more likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than White women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âPreeclampsia is one of the main reasons why there is such a significant disparity in maternal outcomes,â Caveney said. âWith a focus on health equity, we think that better, more evidence-based preeclampsia screening can hopefully help address that, along with lots of other social services and health services and prenatal care to hopefully improve outcomes for pregnancies in the US and beyond.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The new screening test works by identifying and measuring four biomarkers that are associated with preeclampsia risk.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            According to Labcorp, those biomarkers are the placental growth factor or PIGF hormone in the blood; pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A or PAPP-A in the blood; a blood pressure measurement of the average arterial pressure in the arteries; and the patientâs uterine artery pulsatility index or UtAPI, which is measured during an ultrasound.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Having low levels of PlGF and PAPP-A may suggest that the placenta is developing and functioning poorly, according to Labcorp, while high levels of arterial pressure and UtAPI may indicate elevated blood pressure and decreased blood flow in the uterine artery.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            One study published in 2018 in the journal Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology found that the performance of screening âis substantially improvedâ when the screening method includes maternal factors along with biomarkers, such as measurements of mean arterial pressure, UtAPI, PIGF and PAPP-A.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Not all physicians say they would recommend the new screening test for their patients.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThe utility of the test in managing patients has yet to be proven and it is not clear that it helps more than it could possibly hurt.Â It is not clear that the use of this test is any better than the current standards for prenatal care,â Dr. Christian Pettker, chief of obstetrics at Yale-New Haven Hospital and a professor at Yale School of Medicine, wrote in an email.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIt is not clear to me that this is appropriate for all patients who are pregnant in the first trimester.Â Perhaps the most applicable group could be for patients who had preeclampsia in a prior pregnancy, though these patients already have a high risk and are often followed differently in their pregnancy,â Pettker wrote.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âWhile the test is modestly good at predicting which patients may develop preeclampsia, it isnât clear how many patients are improperly told that they will develop preeclampsia,â he added.Â âI would not underestimate the number of patients affected by a false positive.â\n",

      "     \n",
      "            Pettker also had some questions about how the test would be administered to evaluate a patientâs preeclampsia risk, based on biomarkers, and how the ultrasound measurement of uterine artery blood flow âis not a standard test done by ultrasound units or physicians and requires very specific expertise and training.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Labcorp plans to talk with physicians and maternal-fetal specialists about the components of the test, Caveney said, but he added that the screening test could still be ordered using the blood-based biomarkers and regular blood pressure readings.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âMore data is better but not necessary, meaning this test performs best statistically if we have all of the pieces of data from the doctor in order to perform it. However, not every ob-gyn office or ultrasound center routinely has the ability to calculate this uterine artery pulsatility index,â he said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIf they donât provide it, we will still perform the test and give an indication of risk. It just reduces the sensitivity or the likelihood of us being able to accurately predict the risk of preeclampsia,â he said. âIt takes it from a sensitivity of around 90% to the high 70s, which is still significantly higher than assessing traditional maternal risk factors alone.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Eleni Tsigas, chief executive officer of the Preeclampsia Foundation, said that a screening tool like the new first-trimester test could have âsignificantlyâ changed her pregnancy experience if it had existed at the time of her first pregnancy in 1998.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âMy daughter died, and it was all due to a last-minute emergency,â she said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Tsigas was diagnosed with preeclampsia only 11 weeks before her due date, and due to the complications of preeclampsia, her daughter, Nikonia Evangelia Tsigas, was stillborn.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            At the time, Tsigas said, she had only one risk factor: Her daughter was her first pregnancy.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âBut losing your first baby should not be the screening test that youâre at high risk,â Tsigas said. âSo many people are completely caught off-guard in their first pregnancy when they develop preeclampsia, because they didnât have any of these risk factors other than it was their first pregnancy.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Tsigas and her husband went on to have two more children after that first pregnancy, their sons Jordan and Jonathan. For those pregnancies, Tsigas said, she and her care team were more aware of her preeclampsia risk, they monitored her health closely, and she took a low-dose aspirin when recommended by her doctor.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            But something like the newly launched first-trimester screening test, âif itâs done right, it has the potential to eliminate those surprise casesâ of preeclampsia, Tsigas said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThe reason I emphasize âdone rightâ is because what we donât want to do is add another tool to the toolbox thatâs only accessible by some people. Thatâs only going to increase disparities,â she said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThis has issues with payer coverage and education and making sure that all women, no matter their socioeconomic status, are aware that this kind of information should be available to everybody. If it is, it has the potential to reduce the disparities weâre seeing in maternal health outcomes and neonatal health outcomes,â she said. âTests like this absolutely move the bar.â\n",

      "            Laboratory tests by the US Department of Agriculture havenât found any H5N1 bird flu virus in raw beef, but they are a good reminder why eating rare hamburgers can be risky.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            As part of a suite of tests conducted to check safe food handling advice after the detection of H5N1 bird flu virus in dairy cattle, the USDA recently mixed a substitute virus into ground beef and then cooked patties at varying times and temperatures.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Researchers found none of the virus in hamburgers cooked to 145 degrees, roughly the temperature of a medium burger, or well-done burgers cooked to 160 degrees. They did, however, find some live virus in patties cooked to 120 degrees or rare, although the virus was present âat much, much reduced levels,â said Eric Deeble, acting senior adviser for highly pathogenic avian influenza at the USDA.\n",
      "     \n",

      "     \n",
      "            âI donât think that anybody needs to change any of the safe food handling or safe cooking practices that are already recommended,â Deeble said.\n",

      "            The USDA also announced $22 million in new government investments to protect animal health. The bulk of the funding will go to the Animal Disease Preparedness and Response Program and to a network of state laboratories called the National Animal Health Laboratory Network.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThere are some labs that have equipment that needs to be updated or upgraded and additional folks that are interested in adding capacity to the laboratories that they operate. And so this funding is going to help support those types of projects,â Deeble said Thursday.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Between May 6 and May 12, the national lab network processed 1,100 tests for H5N1 bird flu in cattle, and 278 of those were presumed positive, Deeble said.Â He cautioned that because multiple samples can be taken from the same animal or tests may be pooled, the number of tests doesnât reflect the number of animals tested or the number that are positive.Â Approximately 600 of the tests were performed in accordance with the USDAâs new order, which requires testing of dairy cattle moving between states.Â Another 450 tests were performed on animals showing symptoms.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            USDA said that it had gotten a positive response to its offer last week to financially compensate producers who take steps to protect their herds and workers against further spread of the virus. However, it doesnât have the forms ready for farmers to fill out, so nobody has been signed up for the program.Â It hopes to have the paperwork ready by the middle of next week, Deeble said.\n",

EcoHealth Alliance has said it wasÂ unable to access the NIH reporting system because of technical problems, but in a new HHS action memo, it says a forensic report found the group was ânever locked out of the system.â\n",

      "            The origin of the virus that caused Covid-19 continues to drive research and investigations by scientists, intelligence officials and lawmakers.Â Previous scientific studiesÂ have suggested the virus that causes Covid-19 likely emerged naturally in a Wuhan seafood market, but they have not identified a specific origin. The US intelligence communityÂ has maintainedÂ itâs plausible thatÂ Covid-19Â originated in a laboratory or in the wild.\n",

      "            Over about three months, she told CNN in June, the medicine â which is approved for type 2 diabetes and used off-label for weight loss â helped reduce the constant chatter in her brain urging her to eat, just what sheâd hoped it would do.\n",

And now, Ozempicâs maker, Novo Nordisk, said it intends to study the phenomenon.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The company plans to start assessing the effects of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic, and other medicines on alcohol consumption this month in a newly announced clinical trial in alcohol-related liver disease â although cutting drinking isnât the studyâs main goal.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The Danish drug giant has been saying since at least last year that it doesnât plan to study semaglutide â which is also approved for weight loss as Wegovy â in areas like alcohol addiction, despite so many anecdotal reports like Fergusonâs, and academic studies that are already underway.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Novo Nordisk reiterated that stance Wednesday, noting that the main purpose of its new trial is to assess whether the medicines can improve liver health. Its primary measure is the medicinesâ effects on enhanced liver fibrosis, or scarring, over 28 weeks.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âSecondary endpoints include safety and tolerability and changes in alcohol consumption,â a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said in an email. âThere is a significant unmet medical need in alcohol-related liver disease, and the first line of treatment for the condition is lifestyle intervention to refrain from drinking alcohol.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The trial, first reported by Bloomberg News, aims to enroll about 240 participants and is slated to begin May 20, according to a government database.\n",

      "            âEven though not all patients in the trial will have alcohol use disorder, it is natural to include alcohol consumption as a secondary endpoint,â Novo Nordiskâs spokesperson said, noting that the trial is part of the companyâs plans to address liver diseases more broadly.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Nonetheless, researchers in addiction science cheered the news.\n",
      "     \n",

      "     \n",

      "     \n",
      "            Studies in animals suggest the same thing, National Institutes of Health researcher Dr. Lorenzo Leggio told CNN last year. He published a study in May 2023 showing that semaglutide reduces alcohol drinking in rodents, noting that âat least one of the mechanisms of how these drugs reduce alcohol drinking is by reducing the rewarding effects of alcohol,â like those related to the neurotransmitter dopamine.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Jorgensen said Novo Nordisk hadnât studied that effect and had no plans to do so at the time.\n",

      "            âItâsÂ notÂ theÂ easiestÂ toÂ study,â he noted. âYou shouldnât expect that we would go in and study these addictions widely.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Jorgensen did say there could be âan opportunity to collect data when we do large studies,â as well as to use artificial intelligence to mine large databases of experiences with the medicines in the real world for signals of effects on things like alcohol use.\n",

      "            A spokesperson for Eli Lilly, which makes tirzepatide-based competitors to Ozempic and Wegovy called Mounjaro and Zepbound, said Wednesday that it too had seen âanecdotal commentary in publications about the potential use of GLP-1s for additional indications like addiction.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            But while the Indianapolis-based drugmaker continues âto evaluate future development options for tirzepatide,â the spokesperson said the company hadnât announced any plans to develop its medicines for those uses.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Medicines for addiction, and particularly for alcohol use, havenât been successful financially for the drug industry, leading to less interest from pharmaceutical companies in developing drugs in the space.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Research from financial firm TD Cowen found that less than 5% of the 29 million Americans estimated to have alcohol-use disorder receive drug therapy. The firm pointed to issues like doctors not being familiar with medicines to treat alcohol use and compliance with the drugs.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âAlcohol is now the leading cause of cirrhosis and liver transplantation in the US,â Leggio told CNN by email Thursday. âWe do need to develop novel treatments for alcohol-associated liver disease itself, plus novel treatments for the underlying medical problem that leads to ALD; that is, alcohol use disorder.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âItâs very promising and exciting that a company like Novo Nordisk is taking the lead in conducting such an important clinical trial,â Leggio said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Novo Nordisk is looking at multiple medicines in its newly announced trial in alcohol-related liver disease; in addition to semaglutide, the company said it will investigate experimental drugs cagrilintide and zalfermin â listed on the trial posting as NNC0194-0499 â alone and in combination.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Cagrilintide is a medicine that mimics a hormone called amylin that Novo Nordisk is testing in combination with semaglutide â which mimics another hormone, called GLP-1 â in large trials in both diabetes and weight loss, calling the combination CagriSema. Zalfermin, the company said, acts like yet another metabolic hormone, FGF21, which is produced mainly in the liver.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Though trials in use of semaglutide and similar medicines have been slow to start, so many reports of the drugsâ effects on alcohol use have emerged that Leggio, Hendershot and other researchers warned in a commentary in the journal Nature Medicine that the drugs shouldnât be prescribed for alcohol-use disorder until their safety and efficacy has been proven in clinical trials.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âClinical decisions should follow from controlled studies, triangulated with other clinical and preclinical evidence,â the researchers wrote in the December commentary. âWell-controlled [trials] with scientific rigor are needed before any claim of efficacy for alcohol-use disorder and other substance use disorders can be made.â\n",

      "     \n",
      "            Since the Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the constitutional right to an abortion, state fights over abortion access have created plenty of uncertainty for pregnant patients and their doctors. But that uncertainty has also bled into the world of medical education, forcing some new doctors to factor state abortion laws into their decisions about where to begin their careers.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Fourteen states, primarily in the Midwest and South, have banned nearly all abortions.Â The new analysis by the AAMCÂ â a preliminary copy of which was exclusively reviewed by KFF Health News before its public release â found that the number of applicants to residency programs in states with near-total abortion bans declined by 4.2%, compared with a 0.6% drop in states where abortion remains legal.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Notably, the AAMCâs findings illuminate the broader problems abortion bans can create for a stateâs medical community, particularly in an era of provider shortages: The organization tracked a larger decrease in interest in residencies in states with abortion restrictions not only among those in specialties most likely to treat pregnant patients, like OB-GYNs and emergency room doctors, but also among aspiring doctors in other specialties.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIt should be concerning for states with severe restrictions on reproductive rights that so many new physicians â across specialties â are choosing to apply to other states for training instead,â wrote Atul Grover, executive director of the AAMCâs Research and Action Institute.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The AAMC analysis found the number of applicants to OB-GYN residency programs in abortion ban states dropped by 6.7%, compared with a 0.4% increase in states where abortion remains legal. For internal medicine, the drop observed in abortion ban states was over five times as much as in states where abortion is legal.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In its analysis, the AAMC said an ongoing decline in interest in ban states among new doctors ultimately âmay negatively affect access to care in those states.â\n",

      "            Jack Resneck Jr., immediate past president of the American Medical Association, said the data demonstrates yet another consequence of the post-Roe v. WadeÂ era.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The AAMC analysis notes that even in states with abortion bans, residency programs are filling their positions â mostly because there are more graduating medical students in the U.S. and abroad than there are residency slots.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Still, Resneck said, âweâre extraordinarily worried.â For example, physicians without adequate abortion training may not be able to manage miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, or potential complications such as infection or hemorrhaging that could stem from pregnancy loss.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Those who work with students and residents say their observations support the AAMCâs findings. âPeople donât want to go to a place where evidence-based practice and human rights in general are curtailed,â said Beverly Gray, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University School of Medicine.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Abortion in North Carolina is banned in nearly all cases after 12 weeks. Women who experience unexpected complications or discover their baby has potentially fatal birth defects later in pregnancy may not be able to receive care there.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Gray said she worries that even though Duke is a highly sought training destination for medical residents, the abortion ban âimpacts whether we have the best and brightest coming to North Carolina.â\n",

      "            Rohini Kousalya Siva will start her obstetrics and gynecology residency at MedStar Washington Hospital Center in Washington, D.C., this year.

      "     \n",
      "            âWeâre physicians,â said Kousalya Siva, who attended medical school in Virginia and was previously president of the American Medical Student Association. âWeâre supposed to be giving the best evidence-based care to our patients, and we canât do that if we havenât been given abortion training.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Another consideration: Most graduating medical students are in their 20s, âthe age when people are starting to think about putting down roots and starting families,â said Gray, who added that she is noticing many more students ask about politics during their residency interviews.\n",
      "     \n",

      "            With summer coming in the Northern Hemisphere, itâs time to check in with CNN wellness expert and emergency physician Dr. Leana Wen about the dangers of skin cancer and the need for safe sun exposure.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            As we head into summer, what do we need to know about the chance of developing skin cancer? And how can someone know if a mole or skin discoloration needs to be checked out? Which health care provider should be contacted if there is a concern? Should people get full-body skin cancer screening exams? Are self-exams useful?\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Wen has some answers for us, as well as steps everyone can take to reduce the risk of developing skin cancer.Â An emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University, she previously was Baltimoreâs health commissioner.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            CNN: I was surprised to learn that skin cancer is so common. What are the major forms of skin cancer?\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Dr. Leana Wen: There areÂ three main formsÂ of skin cancer. The most common type is called basal cell carcinoma. These cancers can look like an elevated transparent bump on the skin and most frequently occur on the head, neck and other areas most exposed to the sun. Although these cancers generally develop slowly, they can grow deep and damage nerves and bones.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Squamous cell carcinoma is the second most common type of skin cancer. These often resemble a red bump and may manifest as a sore or wound that heals and then opens up again. These, too, tend to appear in areas with frequent sun exposureÂ and can also appear on the lip and ear. They can grow deep and spread to other parts of the body.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Melanoma is the third type that is critical to know. Thatâs because while it only accounts for 1% of total cancers, it is theÂ cause of the majority of deathsÂ from skin cancer. In the United States in 2024, more than 8,000 people will die annually from this cancer.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Melanoma can develop within a mole that already exists or as a new dark spot on the skin. There is also an association with sun exposure and melanoma. According to the American Cancer Society, though melanoma risk increases with age, it isÂ one of the most common cancersÂ in young adults.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            CNN: How can someone know if a mole or skin discoloration should be checked out by a medical professional?\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Wen:Â There is anÂ âABCDEâ ruleÂ that describes warning features that could signify a melanoma. A is for asymmetry, if the shape ofÂ one halfÂ of the mole does not match the other. B is for border. A mole with blurred, irregular edges could be concerning. C is for color, meaning a mole that has multiple colors and shades. D is for diameter. Some melanomas can be very small, but most are over 6 millimeters, about Â¼ inch, wide. E is for evolving, meaning that the mole has changed over the past weeks or months.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Anyone who notices these features of a mole should get it checked out. In addition, people who notice a new growth, a spot or bump that is increasing in size over time, a skin discoloration that is causing discomfortÂ or a sore that doesnâtÂ get betterÂ should also seek medical attention.\n",

      "     \n",
      "            People who have concerning signs that could point to melanoma should clearly state this as a reason â that they have a change in size or color of a mole, for example, and they are concerned about skin cancer.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            CNN: Is it recommended for everyone to receive regular skin cancer screening tests?\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Wen: The influentialÂ USÂ Preventive Services Task Force issued aÂ recommendationÂ in 2023 that there is insufficient evidence to assess the benefits versus risksÂ of regular visual skin examination as a method to screen for skin cancer.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Itâs important to note that this is the general recommendation for people at average risk for skin cancerÂ whoÂ haveÂ no suspicious moles or spots. People who do see concerning new skin changes should be sure to contact their physician right away.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In addition, those who are at increased risk for skin cancer should ask a dermatologist if they should receive regular skin exams. These are done via visual inspection by the physician, meaning that the doctor looks over the entire body. Certain moles may be removed for biopsy to see if they are cancerous.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            CNN: What are factors that put someone at higher risk for skin cancer?\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Wen:Â One main factor is ultraviolet (UV) light exposure. People who have extensive sun exposure, history of sunburns and tanning bed use are at elevated risk. Age is also a risk factor; the longer someone has UV exposure, the higher their risk. Those with 50 or more moles are also at higher risk, as are people with fair complexions.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            There are also specific risk factors related to personal and family medical history. These include personal or family history of skin cancer, history of precancerous lesions such as actinic keratoses, certain genetic disorders such as xeroderma pigmentosum and history of immunosuppression. Individuals with risk factors, or who are not certain about them, should contact their physician to come up with a plan for screening.\n",

      "            CNN: What about self-exams? Can these be helpful?\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Wen: Yes. It is a good idea for everyone to check their skin for moles. Look for the ABCDE warning signs as well as any new spots or sores that are itchy, tenderÂ or painful.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            People should also remember to check everywhere on their bodies. While skin cancer is most likely in sun-exposed areas, other places are possible, too, including the palms of your hands, soles of your feet and genital areas.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            A good time to check is when you shower,Â bathe, change clothesÂ or apply lotion. You could also ask for help from a family member or friend, especially in hard-to-see areas like the scalp.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            CNN: What are steps to reduce the risk of developing skin cancer?\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Wen:ï»¿ Reducing UV exposure is a crucial step that everyone can take. That means, when possible, staying in the shade; wearing clothing that covers arms and legs; wearing a hat that covers the face, head, earsÂ and neck; andÂ regularlyÂ using broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            You can turn to theÂ excellent Environmental Working Groupâs resource on choosing sunscreensÂ that I use and that I recommend to everyone to find an effective sunscreen that works for your lifestyle, budgetÂ and personal preferences.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            People should keep in mind that UV rays penetrate and can cause harm not just during the summer but year-round. Also, UV is not just present when itâs sunny but also on cloudy days, andÂ the raysÂ can reflect off surfaces like snow, sand and water. And itâs not only people who are fair-skinned who can have skin cancer;Â individuals of all colors, including those with brown and Black skin, can develop skin cancer.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Finally, I strongly urge people not to use indoor tanning beds. These expose users to high levels of UV rays and increase the risk of developing skin cancer.\n",

      "     \n",

For example, while people may encourage new parents to ramp up exercise quickly, the healthier approach is to âgo slow, be patient, give yourself grace and remember youâre in healing time.â\n",

      "            Moms may find it easier to reject diet culture and the thin ideal when they recognize the positive influence they can have on their families. âWe are teaching our children how to love themselves,â McLellan said. Even if a mom isnât overtly dieting or weighing herself in front of her kids, âchildren are listening and watching in more ways than you can imagine,â Benfield said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Benefits to children are compelling, but moms deserve to feel better about their bodies for themselves, Benfield added. By resisting harmful ideals, moms are âless burdened and feel more present and therefore more powerful in their own lives.â\n",

      "            âI donât mean bubble baths and fuzzy socks. I mean scheduling our pap smears, scheduling our dental work,â McLellan explained. Finding weight-inclusive providers, especially for moms in larger bodies, is essential not only for body image but for overall health.\n",
      "     \n",

      "            If a mother in your life is struggling with poor body image, it can be tempting to dismiss her concerns and instead offer compliments.

      "     \n",
      "            Really listening and trying to âdecentralize appearanceâ can often be the better way to go, according to Benfield.

      "     \n",
      "            One potential way to express empathy and start a deeper conversation could sound like this: âIsnât it a shame women feel so much pressure to look a certain way, especially in this season of life?â\n",

      "            Itâs no surprise that negative body image and disordered eating tend to increase again in midlife, when women are expected to look as if theyâre âfrozen in timeâ rather than experience the natural and expected changes that come with age, noted Benfield, who treats people with eating disorders.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Women of all ages need to hear her important reminder: âBodies change. And thatâs OK. And letâs normalize that.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Moms may find it easier to reject diet culture and the thin ideal when they recognize the positive influence they can have on their families. âWe are teaching our children how to love themselves,â McLellan said. Even if a mom isnât overtly dieting or weighing herself in front of her kids, âchildren are listening and watching in more ways than you can imagine,â Benfield said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Benefits to children are compelling, but moms deserve to feel better about their bodies for themselves, Benfield added. By resisting harmful ideals, moms are âless burdened and feel more present and therefore more powerful in their own lives.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            A key step in this process involves unlearning a lot of what diet culture has taught us about the importance of thinness.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIt is really important that we unpack our own weight bias,â McLellan said. âWe all have internalized messages because we grew up with them. And the more weâre willing to start doing that work, the more deepened love we can find for ourselves.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            One strategy for moms to feel better about their bodies is to practice meaningful self-care.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âI donât mean bubble baths and fuzzy socks. I mean scheduling our pap smears, scheduling our dental work,â McLellan explained. Finding weight-inclusive providers, especially for moms in larger bodies, is essential not only for body image but for overall health.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            By recognizing weight stigma and truly caring for ourselves, moms can start to âunwrite those messages that we grew up with, thinking that our bodies are wrong or bad and instead really focusing on the importance of our overall wellness,â she added.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            If a mother in your life is struggling with poor body image, it can be tempting to dismiss her concerns and instead offer compliments. While some mothers may appreciate this type of reassurance, it comes with the risk of backfiring because it shuts down her feelings while also reinforcing the importance of how her body looks.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Really listening and trying to âdecentralize appearanceâ can often be the better way to go, according to Benfield. Friends, family and partners can express their unconditional love and even talk directly about the toxicity of our cultureâs unrealistic standards for women.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            One potential way to express empathy and start a deeper conversation could sound like this: âIsnât it a shame women feel so much pressure to look a certain way, especially in this season of life?â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Externalizing and rejecting beauty ideals can be an opening to start resisting the other ways mothers often feel they donât measure up. There is an important reminder every mom needs to hear all year long, McLellan said: âYou are already worthy. Who you are today is wonderful. You are absolutely enough, and you are doing enough.â\n",

      "     \n",
      "            Challenging the prevailing idea that they were all slow, lumbering lizards that basked in the sun to regulate their body temperature, research over the past three decades has revealed that some dinosaurs were likely birdlike, with feathers and perhaps the ability to generate their own body heat.\n",

      "            However, itâs hard to find evidence that unquestionably shows what dinosaur metabolisms were like. Clues from dinosaur eggshells and bones have suggested that some dinosaurs were warm-blooded and others were not.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            A new study published in the journal Current Biology on Wednesday suggested that three main dinosaur groups adapted differently to changes in temperature, with the ability to regulate body temperature evolving in the early Jurassic Period about 180 million years ago.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Based on fossils from 1,000 dinosaur species and paleoclimate information, the new study looked at the spread of dinosaurs across different environments on Earth throughout the dinosaur era, which started some 235 million years agoÂ and ended 66 million years ago when an asteroid slammed into Earth.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Two of the three main groups â meat-eating therapod dinosaurs, which included T. rex, and plant-eating ornithischians, whose notable members included Triceratops and Stegosaurus â spread to live in colder climates during the early Jurassic Period, the research suggested. These dinosaurs may have evolved endothermy, or the ability to internally generate body heat, according to the study.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Therapods and ornithischians lived in a broad range of thermal landscapes in their respective evolutionary histories and were âremarkably adaptable,â the researchers wrote. Recent fossil discoveries have shown that different species of dinosaurs even thrived in the Arctic, giving birth and living there year-round.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âWarm-blooded animals are generally more active, for example, cold-blooded animals usually donât build nests,â said lead study author Dr. Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza, Royal Society Newton International Fellow at University College Londonâs department of Earth sciences.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            By contrast, the towering, plant-eating sauropods kept to warmer, lower-latitude regions of the planet, and the availability of richer foliage in certain habitats wasnât the only factor why, the study found. Sauropods, which included Brontosaurus and Diplodocus, also appeared to thrive in arid, savannahlike environments and practiced âprolonged climatic conservatism,â the researchers wrote.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIt reconciles well with what we imagine about their ecology,â Chiarenza said. âThey were the biggest terrestrial animals that ever lived. They probably would have overheated if they were hot-blooded.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Whatâs more, he added, the amount of plant matter they would have needed to consume if they were warm-blooded would have been unsustainable.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            â(These animals) were living in herds and we know that each one of them was the equivalent of 10 African elephants. (If they were warm-blooded) they would just destroy plant life. It makes more sense, as living animals, for them to be more cold-blooded.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            However, Jasmina Wiemann, a postdoctoral research scientist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, said that the findings from this study contrasted with her own research, which looked at molecular traces of oxygen intake found in dinosaur fossils. Her 2022 study suggested that ornithischians were more likely cold-blooded and sauropods were warm-blooded.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            She questioned to what extent the biogeographic range of a dinosaur was determined by its metabolic capacity as opposed to other factors such as behavior, growth strategy, dietary preferences and other ecological interactions.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âSome animals with incredibly fast growth rates (i.e., sauropods), and by requirement, fast metabolisms, are here found to be cold-blooded, while other animals with very slow growth rates (i.e., ceratopsians) are recovered as endotherms,â Wiemann said. âThese discrepancies will need to be addressed.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Chiarenza said that the model, developed by researchers at UCL and Universidade de Vigo in Spain, suggested that the earliest dinosaurs were more reptilian and cold-blooded. But a period of global warming resulting from volcanic activity 180 million years ago, known as the Jenkyns Event, may have been a trigger for the evolution of the ability to generate body heat internally.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âAt this time, many new dinosaur groups emerged. The adoption of endothermy, perhaps a result of this environmental crisis, may have enabled theropods and ornithischians to thrive in colder environments, allowing them to be highly active and sustain activity over longer periods, to develop and grow faster and produce more offspring,â he said in a news release.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            As with all research based on models, the study made predictions grounded in existing information. New fossils or climatic information might alter that picture. âOf course, if a sauropod turned up in the Arctic that would change things,â Chiarenza said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Paleontologist Anthony Fiorillo, executive director of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science, said the study was âintriguingâ and the âfirst real attempt to quantify broad patterns that some of us had thought about previously.â Fiorillo, who is also a senior fellow at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, wasnât involved with the research.\n",
      "     \n",

      "     \n",
      "            Based on fossils from 1,000 dinosaur species and paleoclimate information, the new study looked at the spread of dinosaurs across different environments on Earth throughout the dinosaur era, which started some 235 million years agoÂ and ended 66 million years ago when an asteroid slammed into Earth.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Two of the three main groups â meat-eating therapod dinosaurs, which included T. rex, and plant-eating ornithischians, whose notable members included Triceratops and Stegosaurus â spread to live in colder climates during the early Jurassic Period, the research suggested. These dinosaurs may have evolved endothermy, or the ability to internally generate body heat, according to the study.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Therapods and ornithischians lived in a broad range of thermal landscapes in their respective evolutionary histories and were âremarkably adaptable,â the researchers wrote. Recent fossil discoveries have shown that different species of dinosaurs even thrived in the Arctic, giving birth and living there year-round.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âWarm-blooded animals are generally more active, for example, cold-blooded animals usually donât build nests,â said lead study author Dr. Alfio Alessandro Chiarenza, Royal Society Newton International Fellow at University College Londonâs department of Earth sciences.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            By contrast, the towering, plant-eating sauropods kept to warmer, lower-latitude regions of the planet, and the availability of richer foliage in certain habitats wasnât the only factor why, the study found. Sauropods, which included Brontosaurus and Diplodocus, also appeared to thrive in arid, savannahlike environments and practiced âprolonged climatic conservatism,â the researchers wrote.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIt reconciles well with what we imagine about their ecology,â Chiarenza said. âThey were the biggest terrestrial animals that ever lived. They probably would have overheated if they were hot-blooded.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Whatâs more, he added, the amount of plant matter they would have needed to consume if they were warm-blooded would have been unsustainable.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            â(These animals) were living in herds and we know that each one of them was the equivalent of 10 African elephants. (If they were warm-blooded) they would just destroy plant life. It makes more sense, as living animals, for them to be more cold-blooded.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            However, Jasmina Wiemann, a postdoctoral research scientist at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, said that the findings from this study contrasted with her own research, which looked at molecular traces of oxygen intake found in dinosaur fossils. Her 2022 study suggested that ornithischians were more likely cold-blooded and sauropods were warm-blooded.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            She questioned to what extent the biogeographic range of a dinosaur was determined by its metabolic capacity as opposed to other factors such as behavior, growth strategy, dietary preferences and other ecological interactions.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âSome animals with incredibly fast growth rates (i.e., sauropods), and by requirement, fast metabolisms, are here found to be cold-blooded, while other animals with very slow growth rates (i.e., ceratopsians) are recovered as endotherms,â Wiemann said. âThese discrepancies will need to be addressed.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Chiarenza said that the model, developed by researchers at UCL and Universidade de Vigo in Spain, suggested that the earliest dinosaurs were more reptilian and cold-blooded. But a period of global warming resulting from volcanic activity 180 million years ago, known as the Jenkyns Event, may have been a trigger for the evolution of the ability to generate body heat internally.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âAt this time, many new dinosaur groups emerged. The adoption of endothermy, perhaps a result of this environmental crisis, may have enabled theropods and ornithischians to thrive in colder environments, allowing them to be highly active and sustain activity over longer periods, to develop and grow faster and produce more offspring,â he said in a news release.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            As with all research based on models, the study made predictions grounded in existing information. New fossils or climatic information might alter that picture. âOf course, if a sauropod turned up in the Arctic that would change things,â Chiarenza said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Paleontologist Anthony Fiorillo, executive director of the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science, said the study was âintriguingâ and the âfirst real attempt to quantify broad patterns that some of us had thought about previously.â Fiorillo, who is also a senior fellow at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, wasnât involved with the research.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âTheir modeling helps create a robustness to our biogeographical understanding of dinosaurs, and their related physiology,â he said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThis study provides a platform for us to further test what we think we might know.â\n",

      "            âNobody had figured out where migratory giant hummingbirds go because they were hiding among the non-migratory giant hummingbirds,â said senior study author Christopher Witt, professor of biology and director of the Museum of Southwestern Biology at the University of New Mexico, in a statement. âThe two forms of giant hummingbird look almost identical â for centuries, ornithologists and birders never noticed that they were different. We couldnât have figured this out without the miniaturized trackers.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            A shift in migratory behavior likely drove the difference between the two species. By studying museum species, including a 154-year-old specimen, the researchers realized that the two types of giant hummingbird had been evolving separately for about 3 million years.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThey are as different from each other as chimpanzees are from bonobos,â Witt said. âThe two species do overlap on their high elevation wintering grounds.

      "            After realizing the two birds were entirely different species, the study team named the northern giant hummingbird Patagona chaski, a nod to chaskis, the Quecha word for messengers, of the Inca Empire.

      "            Along the way, researchers also identified the longest hummingbird migration journey, which spans a 5,200-mile (8,368-kilometer) round trip, or about the distance between New York City and Buenos Aires.\n",

      "     \n",
      "            Darwin observed the birds, which are about eight times the size of typical hummingbirds, breeding along the Pacific coast of Chile, but then they seemed to completely vanish after breeding. He speculated that the giant hummingbirds migrated to the Atacama Desert region, located in northern Chile.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Now, new research has revealed that there are two distinct species of giant hummingbird in South America â the northern giant hummingbird that lives year-round in the Andes, and the migratory southern giant hummingbird â and they have been evolving separately for millions of years.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            A new study describing the birds appeared Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThere arenât many animal migrations of large, charismatic species that are still totally unknown, but that was the case for southern giant hummingbirds,â said lead study author Jessie Williamson, a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow and Rose Postdoctoral Fellow at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in Ithaca, New York. âWe wanted to finally solve this mystery.â\n",

      "     \n",
      "            âEverything about the giants is anomalous â they are not only far larger (two times or more) than the second largest hummingbird â but their wingbeats and heartbeats are far slower,â Williamson said. âAnd their wings are proportionately longer, so they have a completely unique appearance in flight â almost like a hovering swift.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Swifts are medium-size fast-flying birds included in the family Apodidae, which also includes hummingbirds.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            But studying hummingbirds, no matter their size, is an arduous task. The team worked with local landowners and residents of villages across Peru and Chile during fieldwork.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âCapturing Giant Hummingbirds is very challenging,â said study coauthor Emil Bautista, researcher at the Centro de OrnitologÃ­a y Biodiversidad in Lima, in a statement.Â âThey watch everything, and they know their territories well. We had to be strategic in choosing sites for our nets. If Giant Hummingbirds see something unusual, they wonât visit that spot. They are more observant than other birds.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The research team spent nine months camping in rural parts of Chile and Peru, working from sea level to the steep, cactus-strewn slopes of the Andes and going without electricity or running water for weeks at a time, Williamson said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Williamson designed a backpack harness, using a type of jewelry cord to attach a microtracking device to 57 hummingbirds in Chile.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âDesigning appropriate backpack harnesses for giant hummingbirds took two field seasons of trial and error, including practicing the harness design on a stuffed hummingbird finger puppet â¦ with a paper machÃ© mock-up geolocator device, plus lots of consultation with colleagues who have experience tracking small migratory birds,â Williamson said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The geolocator backpacks weighed 0.3 grams and were designed to be small and light enough so they didnât interfere with the birdsâ style of flight.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Williamson published a paper describing her design and how to safely attach it to hummingbirds in the Journal of Avian Biology in June 2021.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âHummingbirds are challenging to work with because they are lightweight with long wings and short legs. Theyâre natureâs tiny acrobats,â she said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            But it wasnât enough to catch the birds, attach the backpacks and release them â the birds had to be recaptured for the team to collect the data.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The researchers were able to retrieve data from eight of the geolocators by recapturing the birds using fine mesh nets called âmist nets,â commonly used by ornithologists, Williamson said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            What the team discovered was that migratory southern giant hummingbirds are like human mountaineers.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The geolocator data revealed that migratory giant hummingbirds can ascend from sea level to more than 13,000 feet (3,962 meters) in elevation, and their travels brought them as far north as the Peruvian Andes.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            But the birds donât just fly directly to these towering altitudes. Instead, like mountaineers, they pause during their ascent for days at a time to allow their blood and lungs to acclimate to lower oxygen levels.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            By tracking the birdsâ migration with geolocators and satellite transmitters, the scientists discovered what they believe to be the longest known hummingbird migration, spanning 5,200 miles (8,368 kilometers) from the Chilean coast up to the Andes in Peru and back.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            As the researchers studied the birds and compared them with genetic data from museum specimens, they realized there were two types of giant hummingbirds.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âNobody had figured out where migratory giant hummingbirds go because they were hiding among the non-migratory giant hummingbirds,â said senior study author Christopher Witt, professor of biology and director of the Museum of Southwestern Biology at the University of New Mexico, in a statement. âThe two forms of giant hummingbird look almost identical â for centuries, ornithologists and birders never noticed that they were different. We couldnât have figured this out without the miniaturized trackers.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            A shift in migratory behavior likely drove the difference between the two species. By studying museum species, including a 154-year-old specimen, the researchers realized that the two types of giant hummingbird had been evolving separately for about 3 million years.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThey are as different from each other as chimpanzees are from bonobos,â Witt said. âThe two species do overlap on their high elevation wintering grounds. Itâs mind-boggling that until now nobody figured out the Giant Hummingbird mystery, yet these two species have been separate for millions of years.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The northern giant hummingbird, which lives in the high Andes year-round, has a different lung and blood capacity compared with the southern giant hummingbird.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            After realizing the two birds were entirely different species, the study team named the northern giant hummingbird Patagona chaski, a nod to chaskis, the Quecha word for messengers, of the Inca Empire. Quecha is a group of indigenous languages used across Peru and neighboring countries.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âChaski runners were surefooted sprinters, capable of speed and endurance on steep slopes, in part due to high-capacity lungs and rigorous aerobic training at high elevations,â the authors wrote in the study.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The researchers reported that both populations of giant hummingbirds are stable, and some can even be seen enjoying nectar from backyard feeders.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Now that the two distinct species have been confirmed, the team wants to better understand how the populations interact, especially when they live in the same parts of the Andes during the winter.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âWe have to figure out where these two forms come together and how they interact,â Witt said. âDo they compete, is one dominant over the other, how might they partition resources, and do they mix or spatially segregate within the winter range? Lots of interesting questions to pursue!â\n",

      "            Eating enough healthy fats is great for brain and heart health, but new research has possibly provided even more evidence for adding them â particularly omega-3s â to your diet.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âWe found that a higher omega-6 to omega-3 ratio is associated with a greater risk of dying,â said Yuchen Zhang, lead author of the April study published in the journal eLife, in a news release. Zhang is a doctoral student in the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Georgiaâs College of Public Health.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Omega-3 fatty acids are naturally found in foods including fish â especially fatty fish such as salmon, tuna and sardines â as well as flaxseed, walnuts, chia seeds and in dietary supplements such as fish oil.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The three main omega-3 fatty acids are alpha-linolenic acid, or ALA; eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA; and docosahexaenoic acid, known as DHA, according to the National Institutes of Health. The body must obtain all three from foods, and omega-3s contribute to the health of the heart, blood vessels, lungs, immune system and endocrine system.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Foods high in omega-6 fatty acids, on the other hand, include nuts, seeds, corn and soy â and the oils and preservatives produced from these foods, the authors said. Linoleic acid is the most common omega-6 fatty acid.Â \n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThere is some evidence to suggest that the high omega-6 to omega-3 fats ratio typical of Western diets â 20:1 or even higher, compared to an estimated 1:1 during most of human evolution â contributes to many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer and autoimmune disorders,â Zhang said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            But the results of past studies have been mixed, she added, and few have investigated the role of an imbalance in mortality. Also, accurately measuring fatty acid intake is difficult, partly due to reliance on participantsâ own recollections of their dietary intake.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Zhang and the other researchers looked into the associations between the omega-3/omega-6 ratio in blood plasma â a more objective measure â and death from any cause and specifically from cancer or cardiovascular disease, the top two leading causes of death worldwide.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            They used data from 85,425 people who had participated in the UK Biobank study, which has followed the health outcomes of more than half a million people between ages 40 and 69 in the United Kingdom for at least a decade.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Participants, whose plasma samples were collected between 2007 and 2010, had answered questionnaires about their diet, including whether they took fish oil supplements.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            After nearly 13 years of follow-up, the authors found participants with the highest ratios of omega-6 to omega-3 were 26% more likely to die early from any cause, 14% more likely to die from cancer and 31% more likely to die from heart disease than those with the lowest ratios. Considered individually, both high levels of omega-6 and omega-3 were linked with a lower risk of premature death. But the protective effects of omega-3 were greater, likely explaining âwhy having a high ratio of omega-6s to omega-3s was linked to harm,â the authors said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Despite the findings, the study is âonly one âsnapshotâ in time of biomarkers and dietary intake of omega 3s and 6s. This is correlation, not causation,â said Dr. Lauren R. Sastre, director of the Farm to Clinic Program and assistant professor in the department of nutrition science at East Carolina University, via email. Sastre wasnât involved in the study.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âAnd even that relationship cannot be strongly supported due to methodological flaws in not considering other dietary components to the overall health/clinical outcomes,â Sastre added. âThere are many anti-inflammatory food components (nutrients, phytochemicals, etc.) that are associated with reducing all-cause, cancer and (cardiovascular disease) mortality, and to only evaluate omega 3s and 6s â strong confounders may be present that would bias the results.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            If the omega-6/omega-3 balance actually does have more to do with premature death risk than the study has the capacity to prove, it could be due to the possible function of arachidonic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, said Kristin Kirkpatrick, a registered dietitian nutritionist at the Cleveland Clinic and author of âRegenerative Health: Discover Your Metabolic Type and Renew Your Liver for Life.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Arachidonic acid is what the body converts from linoleic acid. Itâs a âbuilding block for molecules that can promote inflammation, blood clotting, and the constriction of blood vessels,â according to Harvard Health. But this fatty acid can also be converted into molecules that fight inflammation and blood clots.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Omega-6s arenât inherently bad, but having too many may offset the anti-inflammatory factors associated with omega-3, Kirkpatrick said, so âa more balanced approach â¦ may be favorable.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThe source of the omega 6s may also be a factor in offsetting the balance as well,â she added via email. âProcessed seed oils may also contain high amounts of omega 6s for example.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Focusing on this balance and increasing your intake of foods rich in omega-3s can be more important than simply limiting those high in omega-6s, Kirkpatrick said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âI would also look at the quality of the omega 6 foods in the diet,â she added, âaiming for whole foods â¦ rather than more processed products that may contain large amounts via the addition of seed oils.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            If youâre curious what your blood plasma ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 is, ask your physician about testing for it. In Kirkpatrickâs practice, she often works with her patientsâ doctors for this purpose. Some patients request it with the goal of improving their mental health, heart health or risk of dementia, she said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Overall, âitâs important to note that an unbalanced ratio is only one chapter in our story of better or worse health span,â Kirkpatrick said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âGetting a variety of fiber-rich foods (beneficial to the microbiome) and other nutrient-dense foods, as well as adequate, good-quality sleep, stress management and physical activity play a large role in how long we will enjoy good health within our lifetime.â\n",

      "            The researchers gave each individual a polygenetic risk score, which is a score summarizing the presence of multiple genes found to impact human lifespan, according to the study. The study participants also received a score based on how they adhered to healthy lifestyle tenets, and then were followed for an average of 13 years to see if they had a short, intermediate or long lifespan.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Everyone, regardless of their genetic risks, were 78% more likely to die early if they had an unhealthy lifestyle, the data showed.\n",

      "            And people with both a genetic risk for a short lifespan and an unhealthy lifestyle were twice as likely to die early as those without genetic risk and healthier lifestyles, said Wu, who is also director of National Institute for Data Science in Health and Medicine of Zhejiang University.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Individuals with genetic risk could extend their lifespan by up to 5.5 years with a healthy lifestyle, the data showed.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âAdherence to a healthy lifestyle could substantially attenuate the lifespan reduction for individuals with genetic susceptibility to a shorter lifespan,â Wu said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The study was observational, meaning that it could determine associations but could not say for sure that the behaviors were the direct cause of the changes in lifespan.\n",
      "     \n",

      "            Ultraprocessed foods contain additives such as flavor enhancers, colors and thickeners â basically ingredients you wouldnât usually use in your cooking.Â It makes them shelf-stable, easy to prepare (just heat and serve) and in many cases hard to resist. (The food industry pushes back on the NOVA system, saying there is no agreed-upon scientific consensus on the definition of ultraprocessed.)\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Due to a confluence of historical, regulatory and economic factors, Nestle said, food companies in the 1980s âdid a lot of work on trying to figure out what flavor and texture and color combinations would be most attractive to people and started producing foods that would make them lots of money.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            She said tens of thousands of new products have hit store shelves since then. âMost of them fail, but the ones that win, win big,â Nestle said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Before you reach for that can of soda, bag of chips or frozen dinner, why not learn more about what youâre eating? Here are five things to know about ultraprocessed foods:\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Eating a lot of ultraprocessed foods isnât healthy.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âNow there have been more than 1,500 observational studies â all of them demonstrating a consistent finding, which is that eating ultraprocessed foods is linked to obesity,Â type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers, bad outcome from Covid-19, overall mortality,â Nestle said. âAny bad health problem you can think of thatâs related to diet is related specifically to ultraprocessed foods.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The most recent study, published Wednesday in The BMJ journal, analyzed more than 30 yearsâ worth of data and found that eating ultraprocessed foods was associated with a 4% higher risk of death by any cause, including a 9% increased risk of neurodegenerative deaths. Other studies have linked ultraprocessed foods to heart disease, type 2 diabetes, cancer and mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Nestle pointed out that these studies have been observational and not designed to prove causation â that ultraprocessed foods caused these bad health outcomes.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âYou can do that when you have a controlled clinical trial,â she said. âAnd guess what? We have one.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            That one randomized, controlled clinical trial showed that ultraprocessed foods actually caused people to gain weight.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            These types of studies are not easy or cheap to undertake, which is why they are not done more often. To conduct this one, Dr. Kevin Hall, a senior investigator at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, had 20 volunteers spend four weeks living at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            For two weeks, they ate a diet made up of 80% healthy ultraprocessed foods (think yogurt and whole wheat bread, not chips and soda). For the other two weeks, they ate a diet that contained no ultraprocessed foods. The diets were matched, among other things, for calories, sugar, fat, fiber and macronutrients. Participants did not know what exactly the study was measuring.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âWe basically just asked people, you know, just eat as much or as little of the food that youâd like,â Hall told Tirrell. âYou shouldnât be trying to change your weight, (you) shouldnât be trying to gain weight or lose weight.Â Just eat to the same level of appetite as you normally would.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Researchers found that when the participants were on the ultraprocessed diet, they ate about 500 calories more per day than when they were on the minimally processed one. This difference in calories translated quickly to the scale. Participants gained on average 2 pounds during the two weeks on the ultraprocessed diet and lost 2 pounds on the minimally processed one. And their blood work showed lower markers of inflammation when they were on the latter.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIf youâre not familiar with nutrition research, you have no idea what an important finding this is,â said Nestle, who was not involved in the study. âFive hundred calories is huge.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Hall said itâs unclear what drives people to consume more calories when they are on an ultraprocessed diet. âOne of the things that weâre really interested in now,â he said, âis to figure out what the mechanisms were.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Ultraprocessed foods are everywhere, and most of us consume them without even realizing it â even when you think you are eating something relatively healthy, such as baked potato chips or a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, researchers found that ultraprocessed foods make up more than half of American adultsâ diets. For US children, that percentage is even higher, at 67%.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Yup, thatâs right: Truly eating âcleanâ costs more.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âTo actually create the minimally processed menu, it was about 40% more expensive than the ultraprocessed menu,â Hall said. âThat doesnât even account for the time that it takes to make the foods, right? So, all those factors probably play a huge role in â¦ the foods that we choose to eat in the real world.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Some ultraprocessed foods can provide important nutrients, such as whole wheat bread and yogurt. And others, in Hallâs study, were shown not to increase caloric intake.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThe snacks were neutral in terms of how many calories (the participants) ate,â Hall said. âWhich goes to show that not all ultraprocessed foods necessarily drive this effect.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Hallâs team is conducting a new study to tease out which ultraprocessed foods are harmful and which are neutral, or even healthy.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Americans may soon get more help sorting through the health effects of ultraprocessed foods. The US Department of Agriculture and the US Food and Drug Administration will soon issue new Dietary Guidelines, which are updated every five years. Nestle said that the scientific advisory committee guiding this process has been asked to consider the connection between ultraprocessed foods and poor health outcomes.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            We hope these five things help you understand ultraprocessed foods a bit more. Listen to the full episode here to find out how much ultraprocessed food Hall eats and what he feeds his children.\n",

      "     \n",

      "     \n",
      "            Breakfast may be the easiest meal to change. Instead of sugar-fortified cereal or toaster waffles,Â have some warm and filling ancient grains such as quinoa, sorghum or wheat berries cooked with milk, honey, nuts and fruits. No time in the morning to prepare breakfast? Prep these overnight oats the night before. Or have a simple small bowl of plain Greek yogurt with fresh fruit and a sprinkle of sliced nuts to go.\n",

      "     \n",
      "            Ultraprocessed foods are those that contain ingredients ânever or rarely used in kitchens, or classes of additives whose function is to make the final product palatable or more appealing,â according to theÂ Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Those ingredients â found in things such as sodas, chips, packaged soups, nuggets and ice cream â can include preservatives against mold or bacteria, artificial coloring, emulsifiers to stop separation, and added or altered sugar, salt and fats to make food more appealing.\n",

      "     \n",
      "            The study analyzed data from more than 100,000 health professionals in the United States with no history of cancer, cardiovascular disease or diabetes. From 1986 to 2018, the participants provided information on their health and lifestyle habits every two years.\n",

      "            Findings in this study were consistent with hundreds of others in the field, but what makes this one unique is its parsing out of different subgroups within the ultraprocessed food category, said Dr. Marion Nestle, the Paulette Goddard professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Song wouldnât necessarily advise a complete rejection of all ultraprocessed foods because it is a diverse category, he said.\n",

      "            âCereals, whole grain breads, for example, they are also considered ultraprocessed food, but they contain various beneficial nutrients like fiber, vitamins and minerals,â he said. âOn the other hand, I do think people should try to avoid or limit the consumption of certain ultraprocessed foods, such as processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages and also potentially artificially sweetened beverages.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            There are also more questions that need to be answered when it comes to ultraprocessed foods.\n",

      "            First, the recent study is strong because of the length of time coveredï»¿, but it is an observational study. That means that while researchers can observe a correlation, they canât say that the foods were the cause of the deaths, said Dr. Peter Wilde, emeritus fellow at Quadram Institute Bioscience in the United Kingdom.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Researchers also need to look more at the components of ultraprocessed foods that might be affecting health â whether they be food additives, emulsifiers or flavors â to advise governments and institutions on how to regulate foods, Song said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Researchers also found that the most important factor to reducing risk of death is the quality of a personâs overall diet, Song said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIf people maintain a generally healthy diet, I donât think they need to be like scared or be freaked out,â he said. âThe overall dietary pattern is still the predominant factor determining the health outcomes.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            A healthy diet is varied, with as many colorful fruits and vegetables and whole grains as possible, Wilde said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIf you are worried about food additives, then choose foods that have low levels of additives,â he said in an email. âJust be mindful of the nutritional content of (the ultraprocessed foods) that you do choose to consume.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            It is also important to recognize that foods need to be eaten in balance. Fruit juice contains beneficial vitamins, minerals and antioxidants when consumed in moderation, but too much will have high levels of sugar that may override their benefits, Wilde said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThis is not black and white,â he said. âA particular food is not either good or bad, it will contain elements of both, and the balance between the two may depend on how much you eat.â\n",

      "     \n",
      "            About 50% of children will talk in their sleep â and typically outgrow it â while only about 5% of adults are nighttime blabbermouths, according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. However, about 60% to 65% of adults will experience at least one episode of nighttime speech during their lifetime, the academy said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Sleep soliloquies can occur at any stage of sleep, not just in rapid eye movement (REM), theÂ stage when dreams occur, experts say. These one-sided conversations are typically harmless and can include mumbled whispers, groans and nonsense words as well as vulgar language and outright yelling.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            At that point, a bed partner may cease to view the chatter as amusing and start looking for ways to protect their own sleep, said sleep disorder specialist Dr. Carlos Schenck, a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThere are some things you, the bed partner, can do to save your sleep,â Schenck said. âBut first make sure there are no hidden issues that might be causing the problem.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Sleep talking, or somniloquy, can be connected to mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression and anxiety. Medications to treat depression, and other mental health disorders, high blood pressure, seizures, asthma and, oddly, other sleep disorders can also cause sleep talking, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIf your partner has never been a sleep talker and suddenly starts sleep talking after the age of 50, and it becomes louder and more frequent, then you really should reach out to your doctor for a neurological evaluation,â Schenck said. âIt could be the first sign of a neurodegenerative disorder, such as Parkinsonâs.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Obstructive sleep apnea â a serious sleep disorder in which people stop breathing for 10 seconds to two minutes 30 or more times an hour â can also cause the brain to partially wake and begin to jabber. Bed partners are often the first to notice sleep apnea, observing a total cessation of breathing, followed by a gasp of air.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Acid reflux or itâs more serious cousin, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can also create a partial arousal that can trigger the brain into speech, Schenck said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            A white noise generator or loud fan is a great defense, said Jennifer Mundt, assistant professor of sleep medicine, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern Universityâs Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âEarplugs or comfortable noise-canceling headphonesÂ may also help,â she said. Earplugs come in several forms: expandable foam, pre-molded versions and custom molded, which are created to precisely fit the shape and size of the ear canal.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThen try to go to sleep before the person who sleep talks so that you are not easily awakened. Thatâs where a white noise generator or loud fan can be very, very helpful,â Schenck said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Now, itâs time for some detective work. Work with your bed partner to discover triggers for their sleep talking, such as stress, the use of alcohol, being sleep-deprived, not sticking to a normal sleep schedule or even sleeping in a new environment, experts say.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            For some people, something as benign as being on vacation or sleeping somewhere new can cause an episode, Mundt said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âAt these times your brain is a little more vigilant because youâre in a new environment, and that means youâre more likely to have this partial awakening, where one part of the brain is awake and the other part is asleep,â Mundt said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In the end, itâs the responsibility of the person who sleep talks to take ownership of their disorder and find solutions to quit disturbing a partnerâs sleep, Schenck said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThe person who is sleep talking has to be very considerate of the partner,â Schenck said. âIf sleeping on your back makes it worse, then get a nightshirt where you can put a tennis ball in the back of the shirt so you canât sleep on your back.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            And if drinking alcohol is a trigger, that should be stopped or diminished as well, he said. âCut out alcohol so you can share your consideration for the bed partner who is disturbed by your sleep talking.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Sleep talking is a parasomnia, in the same category as sleep terrors, sleep eating, sleep paralysis and sleep sex. All are disorders of arousal, in which part of the brain wakes while the rest sleeps.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Parasomnias often run in families, and you are more likely to have one if you had one as a child. If more than one first-degree relative has a parasomnia, then itâs much more likely that childhood sleep behaviors will remain or reoccur as an adult, Schenck said.\n",
      "     \n",

      "            In early March, Dr. Barb Petersen, a large-animal vet in Texas, began getting calls from the dairy farms she works with in the Panhandle.Â Workers there were seeing a lot of cows with mastitis, an infection of the udder.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Their milk was thickened and discolored, and it couldnât be explained by any of the usual suspects such as bacteria or tissue damage.\n",

      "            Several more dairies called.Â One owner told her he thought his farm had âwhatever is going around, and half of my pets have died,â indicating that the contagion had moved beyond cattle.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            After running a battery of tests and ruling out every cause she could think of, Petersen sent samples from sick and dead animals to the Texas A&M state veterinary lab and to friends and colleagues at Iowa State University.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            What they found â loads of the H5N1 influenza virus â has rocked the dairy industry and put public health officials around the world on alert. It also created an urgent scientific to-do list. One of the first questions that needed to be answered was how the virus was infecting cows in the first place.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Researchers in the US and Denmark took on that task. Their findings, published as a preprint study, show that cows have the same receptors for flu viruses as humans and birds. Scientists fear that cows could be mixing bowls â hosts that help the virus learn to better spread between people. Such an event, while rare, experts say, could put us on the path to another pandemic.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            For years, H5N1, or highly pathogenic avian influenza, has been primarily confined to the bird population, but it has recently begun to infect a growing number of mammals, suggesting that the virus might be adapting and moving closer to becoming a human pathogen.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Avian flu viruses have decimated commercial poultry flocks in the US, and because pigs are known to catch bird flu viruses, swine have been closely monitored for signs of infection â but cows werenât on anyoneâs radar as potential hosts.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Since late March, 42 infected herds have been found in nine states, according to the the US Department of Agriculture. Only one person has been found to be infected with H5N1 after contact with infected cows, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current risk to public health is low, although it is working with states to monitor people with animal exposures.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThe finding in cattle has been so different,â said Dr. Lars Larsen, a professor of veterinary clinical microbiology at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. In mammals, influenza typically infects the lungs. In cats, it can also infect the brain. âHere we see an enormous amount of virus in the mammary and in the milk,â Larsen said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Larsen said the concentration of H5N1 viruses in the milk of infected cows is 1,000 times higher than typically seen in infected birds.Â He said he and his colleagues calculated that even if the milk from a single infected cow were diluted in 1,000 tons of milk, scientists would still be able to pick up traces of the virus in lab tests.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Tests by the US Food and Drug Administration found inert fragments of genetic material from the H5N1 virus in about 1 out of 5 samples of milk purchased on grocery store shelves, raising questions about how the virus had become so widespread. Researchers confirmed in later tests that the pasteurized milk it tested wasnât infectious and couldnât make anyone sick.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            That hasnât stopped the outbreak from rattling more than a few nerves. Thereâs big money riding on the health of cows. Milk and dairy products were the fourth largest agricultural commodity in the US in terms of cash receipts in 2022, according to the USDAâs economic research service. Sales of cattle and calves were the second largest commodity.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Viruses need a way to hack into cells.Â For the virus that causes Covid-19, the key is a receptor called ACE2.Â For flu viruses, itâs a sugar molecule that sticks up from the surface of cells called a sialic acid.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Different animals carry different forms, or shapes, of sialic acids. Birds have sialic acid receptors that are slightly different shapes from than the ones humans have in their upper respiratory tracts.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            If you hold your index finger straight up, thatâs kind of what a birdâs sialic acid receptor looks like, says Dr. Andy Pekosz, a molecular microbiologist and immunologist at Johns Hopkins University.Â If you bend your finger at the knuckle into an upside-down L, thatâs what human sialic acid receptor looks like. Flu viruses tend to prefer to bind to one shape over the other, he said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Researchers think this may be one reason why H5N1, which originated in birds, hasnât been shown to spread efficiently between people.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Until recently, nobody knew what kind of sialic acid receptors cows had, because it was believed that they didnât catch A-strain flu viruses like H5N1.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Larsen and his colleagues in the US and Denmark took tissue samples from the lungs, windpipes, brains and mammary glands of calves and cows and stained them with compounds that they knew would attach to different kinds of sialic acid receptors.Â They sliced the stained tissues very thinly and peered at them under a microscope.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            What they saw was surprising: The tiny milk-producing sacs of the udder, called alveoli, were brimming with sialic acid receptors, and they had both the kind of receptors associated with birds and those that are more common in people.Â Almost every cell they looked at contained both types of receptors, said lead study author Dr. Charlotte Kristensen, a postdoctoral researcher in veterinary pathology at the University of Copenhagen.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            That finding has raised concern because one way flu viruses change and evolve is by swapping pieces of their genetic material with other flu viruses.Â This process, called reassortment, requires that a cell be infected with two different flu viruses at the same time.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIf you get both viruses in the same cell at the same time, you can essentially get hybrid viruses coming out of it,â said study author Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In order to be infected simultaneously with two flu viruses â a bird flu virus and a human flu virus â a cell would need to have both kinds of sialic acid receptors, which cows do, something that wasnât known before this study.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âI think this is probably a pretty rare event,â said Webby, who has been studying the H5N1 virus for 25 years.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In order for something like that to happen, a cow infected with the bird flu virus would need to pick up a different flu strain from an infected human.Â Currently, human flu infections are low across the country and dropping as flu season winds down, making the possibility of something like this happening even more remote.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Still, itâs not unheard-of.\n",

      "            In early March, Dr. Barb Petersen, a large-animal vet in Texas, began getting calls from the dairy farms she works with in the Panhandle.Â Workers there were seeing a lot of cows with mastitis, an infection of the udder.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Their milk was thickened and discolored, and it couldnât be explained by any of the usual suspects such as bacteria or tissue damage.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Several more dairies called.Â One owner told her he thought his farm had âwhatever is going around, and half of my pets have died,â indicating that the contagion had moved beyond cattle.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            After running a battery of tests and ruling out every cause she could think of, Petersen sent samples from sick and dead animals to the Texas A&M state veterinary lab and to friends and colleagues at Iowa State University.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            What they found â loads of the H5N1 influenza virus â has rocked the dairy industry and put public health officials around the world on alert. It also created an urgent scientific to-do list. One of the first questions that needed to be answered was how the virus was infecting cows in the first place.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Researchers in the US and Denmark took on that task. Their findings, published as a preprint study, show that cows have the same receptors for flu viruses as humans and birds. Scientists fear that cows could be mixing bowls â hosts that help the virus learn to better spread between people. Such an event, while rare, experts say, could put us on the path to another pandemic.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            For years, H5N1, or highly pathogenic avian influenza, has been primarily confined to the bird population, but it has recently begun to infect a growing number of mammals, suggesting that the virus might be adapting and moving closer to becoming a human pathogen.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Avian flu viruses have decimated commercial poultry flocks in the US, and because pigs are known to catch bird flu viruses, swine have been closely monitored for signs of infection â but cows werenât on anyoneâs radar as potential hosts.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Since late March, 42 infected herds have been found in nine states, according to the the US Department of Agriculture. Only one person has been found to be infected with H5N1 after contact with infected cows, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the current risk to public health is low, although it is working with states to monitor people with animal exposures.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThe finding in cattle has been so different,â said Dr. Lars Larsen, a professor of veterinary clinical microbiology at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. In mammals, influenza typically infects the lungs. In cats, it can also infect the brain. âHere we see an enormous amount of virus in the mammary and in the milk,â Larsen said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Larsen said the concentration of H5N1 viruses in the milk of infected cows is 1,000 times higher than typically seen in infected birds.Â He said he and his colleagues calculated that even if the milk from a single infected cow were diluted in 1,000 tons of milk, scientists would still be able to pick up traces of the virus in lab tests.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Tests by the US Food and Drug Administration found inert fragments of genetic material from the H5N1 virus in about 1 out of 5 samples of milk purchased on grocery store shelves, raising questions about how the virus had become so widespread. Researchers confirmed in later tests that the pasteurized milk it tested wasnât infectious and couldnât make anyone sick.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            That hasnât stopped the outbreak from rattling more than a few nerves. Thereâs big money riding on the health of cows. Milk and dairy products were the fourth largest agricultural commodity in the US in terms of cash receipts in 2022, according to the USDAâs economic research service. Sales of cattle and calves were the second largest commodity.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Viruses need a way to hack into cells.Â For the virus that causes Covid-19, the key is a receptor called ACE2.Â For flu viruses, itâs a sugar molecule that sticks up from the surface of cells called a sialic acid.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Different animals carry different forms, or shapes, of sialic acids. Birds have sialic acid receptors that are slightly different shapes from than the ones humans have in their upper respiratory tracts.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            If you hold your index finger straight up, thatâs kind of what a birdâs sialic acid receptor looks like, says Dr. Andy Pekosz, a molecular microbiologist and immunologist at Johns Hopkins University.Â If you bend your finger at the knuckle into an upside-down L, thatâs what human sialic acid receptor looks like. Flu viruses tend to prefer to bind to one shape over the other, he said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Researchers think this may be one reason why H5N1, which originated in birds, hasnât been shown to spread efficiently between people.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Until recently, nobody knew what kind of sialic acid receptors cows had, because it was believed that they didnât catch A-strain flu viruses like H5N1.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Larsen and his colleagues in the US and Denmark took tissue samples from the lungs, windpipes, brains and mammary glands of calves and cows and stained them with compounds that they knew would attach to different kinds of sialic acid receptors.Â They sliced the stained tissues very thinly and peered at them under a microscope.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            What they saw was surprising: The tiny milk-producing sacs of the udder, called alveoli, were brimming with sialic acid receptors, and they had both the kind of receptors associated with birds and those that are more common in people.Â Almost every cell they looked at contained both types of receptors, said lead study author Dr. Charlotte Kristensen, a postdoctoral researcher in veterinary pathology at the University of Copenhagen.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            That finding has raised concern because one way flu viruses change and evolve is by swapping pieces of their genetic material with other flu viruses.Â This process, called reassortment, requires that a cell be infected with two different flu viruses at the same time.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIf you get both viruses in the same cell at the same time, you can essentially get hybrid viruses coming out of it,â said study author Dr. Richard Webby, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In order to be infected simultaneously with two flu viruses â a bird flu virus and a human flu virus â a cell would need to have both kinds of sialic acid receptors, which cows do, something that wasnât known before this study.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âI think this is probably a pretty rare event,â said Webby, who has been studying the H5N1 virus for 25 years.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In order for something like that to happen, a cow infected with the bird flu virus would need to pick up a different flu strain from an infected human.Â Currently, human flu infections are low across the country and dropping as flu season winds down, making the possibility of something like this happening even more remote.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Still, itâs not unheard-of.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Pigs also have both human and bird sialic acid receptors in their respiratory tracts, and flu infections in pigs have been known to spark pandemic viruses.Â The 2009 pandemic caused by H1N1 influenza, for example, is believed to have started in pigs in Mexico when the virus reassorted to become one that was able to spread quickly between people.\n",

      "     \n",
      "            Malaria is not considered a big threat to the US blood supply like it is in some other countries. But nearly 28 million US residents travel to parts of the world where malaria is common each year, the FDA says, and as more Americans travel and as the planet gets warmer, scientists have predicted that the disease couldÂ become more likely in the US, even with aggressive mosquito control.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            As late as the 1940s, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday in a presentation to the FDAâs advisory committee, the US had about 65,000 cases of malaria a year â but that changed when the country needed healthy service members to fight in World War II. Knowing that many would train in malaria-prone areas in the South, President Franklin Delano Rooseveltâs government waged a war on mosquitoes that paid off.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            By 1949, according to the CDC, malaria was no longer considered a significant health problem in the US, and WHO declared the US free of the disease in 1970.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The US still has about 2,000 cases a year, according to the CDC, but most are travel-related.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The CDC noted that although the risk of locally acquired malaria in the US continues to be âextremely low,â just last summer, it warned doctors to watch for locally acquired cases. There were a handful of non-travel-related cases in Texas, Florida, Maryland and Arkansas last year, the first locally acquired malaria cases in the US since 2003.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In March, the FDA approved the first test intended to screen donor blood for the evidence of malaria. The Cobas malaria test, made by Roche, can detect RNA and DNA from the parasite that causes malaria in donor blood, organs and tissue.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Malaria transmission through a blood transfusion is not common, but an infection can trigger severe symptoms and even death, studies show.

      "     \n",
      "            Another study found 13 malaria cases related to blood donations between 2000 and 2021, the FDA said, but seven of the cases involvedï»¿ donors who met current FDA eligibility criteria.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âItâs complicated, and it doesnât prevent all cases,â Jennifer Scharpf, associate director for policy in the agencyâs Office of Blood Research and Review, said of the current guidelines.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The FDA told the committee Wednesday that its current guidance comes with a high level of âcomplexityâ and that blood bank workers must assess several potential risk factors.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Blood banks use a donor history questionnaire to screen for people who have had malaria or who lived in a country where the disease is endemic in the past three years. People are also deferred from donating if they have traveled to a country with endemic malaria in the previous three months; or if they were a resident of a malaria-endemic country, if they have spent less than three consecutive years in a country where malaria is endemic, or if they have a history of travel to a malaria-endemic area in the previous three years. The rules are slightly different for platelet and plasma component collection.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            ï»¿These questionnaires have limitations, and the screening process is âerror-prone,â the FDA said. Deferral periods may also not be sufficient to catch asymptomatic donors, particularly for residents of countries where malaria is common, because they may have partial immunity from a previous infectionï»¿.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            On the other hand, the current guidance disqualifies a large group of healthy potential donors, the FDA said. Some estimates say that between 1% and 3% of all donors are turned away based on travel history alone, and blood banks say they can never get enough donors.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Scharpf told the committee that about 50,000 to 160,000 donors may be deferred annually, and studies show that manyï»¿ people who are deferred often donât return, even when they are eligible to donate.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The FDA is considering a couple of strategies to update its guidelines.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The first consideration is to do selective testing of a donorâs blood based on their history of malaria infection, having traveled to a malaria-endemic area in the previous three months or having ever lived in a malaria-endemic country. Another option is to test all donors at least one time and then to selectively test donations from people at risk of exposure, including those who had ever had malaria and those who had traveled to a malaria-endemic area in the previous three months.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Most of the advisoryï»¿ committee members seemed to favor the first option, saying the second seemed like overkill.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âItâs such a low incidence of disease, and itâs treatable,â said committee member Dr. Richard Scanlan, a professor, vice chair of the Laboratory Medicine Transfusion Service and medical director at Oregon Health & Science University.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The FDA is also considering requiring testing of all blood donated in areas where there was even one locally transmitted malaria case recently, but the committee members seemed less sure about this idea.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Committee member Dr. Sanjay Ahuja, director of Rainbow Hemostasis & Thrombosis Center at Rainbow Babies & Childrenâs Hospital in Cleveland, said that if there is proven local transmission, the decision of ï»¿when to test all donor blood from the area is a âdifficult one.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThere are so many nuances to this,â Ahuja said. âI think it might be a little bit much in my opinion, but I donât know whether more evidence of local transmission should be in place before we say âyesâ to this.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            During the meetingâs public comment period, leaders of someï»¿ blood supply organizations encouraged the FDA to take a cautious approach to changing the guidelines.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Ralph Vassallo, incoming chair of the Association for the Advancement of Blood & BiotherapiesÂ Transfusion Transmitted Disease Committee, said his group joinsï»¿ Americaâs Blood Centers and the American Red Cross in believing that the new test for malaria holds real promise to improve blood safety and may improve the availability of donors by removing âunnecessary donor deferrals,â particularly among subsets of donors with uncommon blood types, such as those from Latin American, Asian and African countries.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            But, he told the committee, there are no clinical studies that show that the test reduces the risk of transfusion-transmitted malaria.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Vassallo also encouraged the FDA to use flexible testing strategies and said that although the groups supported limited testing of all donations in ZIP codes with local malaria transmission, one case should not be enough to trigger such testing.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âFDA should support formal modeling studies designed in consultation with malariologists using the best available assumptions about parasite levels during asymptomatic infection before issuing final guidance,â he said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The committee did not vote on the proposed strategies, but the FDA said it would take the discussion into consideration as it considered changing its guidance.\n",

      "            By 1949, according to the CDC, malaria was no longer considered a significant health problem in the US, and WHO declared the US free of the disease in 1970.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The US still has about 2,000 cases a year, according to the CDC, but most are travel-related.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The CDC noted that although the risk of locally acquired malaria in the US continues to be âextremely low,â just last summer, it warned doctors to watch for locally acquired cases. There were a handful of non-travel-related cases in Texas, Florida, Maryland and Arkansas last year, the first locally acquired malaria cases in the US since 2003.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In March, the FDA approved the first test intended to screen donor blood for the evidence of malaria. The Cobas malaria test, made by Roche, can detect RNA and DNA from the parasite that causes malaria in donor blood, organs and tissue.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Malaria transmission through a blood transfusion is not common, but an infection can trigger severe symptoms and even death, studies show. A CDC study found that from 1963 through 1999, there were just 93 cases spread through donated blood in the US, but 10 of those people died.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Another study found 13 malaria cases related to blood donations between 2000 and 2021, the FDA said, but seven of the cases involvedï»¿ donors who met current FDA eligibility criteria.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âItâs complicated, and it doesnât prevent all cases,â Jennifer Scharpf, associate director for policy in the agencyâs Office of Blood Research and Review, said of the current guidelines.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The FDA told the committee Wednesday that its current guidance comes with a high level of âcomplexityâ and that blood bank workers must assess several potential risk factors.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Blood banks use a donor history questionnaire to screen for people who have had malaria or who lived in a country where the disease is endemic in the past three years. People are also deferred from donating if they have traveled to a country with endemic malaria in the previous three months; or if they were a resident of a malaria-endemic country, if they have spent less than three consecutive years in a country where malaria is endemic, or if they have a history of travel to a malaria-endemic area in the previous three years. The rules are slightly different for platelet and plasma component collection.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            ï»¿These questionnaires have limitations, and the screening process is âerror-prone,â the FDA said. Deferral periods may also not be sufficient to catch asymptomatic donors, particularly for residents of countries where malaria is common, because they may have partial immunity from a previous infectionï»¿.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            On the other hand, the current guidance disqualifies a large group of healthy potential donors, the FDA said. Some estimates say that between 1% and 3% of all donors are turned away based on travel history alone, and blood banks say they can never get enough donors.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Scharpf told the committee that about 50,000 to 160,000 donors may be deferred annually, and studies show that manyï»¿ people who are deferred often donât return, even when they are eligible to donate.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The FDA is considering a couple of strategies to update its guidelines.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The first consideration is to do selective testing of a donorâs blood based on their history of malaria infection, having traveled to a malaria-endemic area in the previous three months or having ever lived in a malaria-endemic country. Another option is to test all donors at least one time and then to selectively test donations from people at risk of exposure, including those who had ever had malaria and those who had traveled to a malaria-endemic area in the previous three months.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Most of the advisoryï»¿ committee members seemed to favor the first option, saying the second seemed like overkill.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âItâs such a low incidence of disease, and itâs treatable,â said committee member Dr. Richard Scanlan, a professor, vice chair of the Laboratory Medicine Transfusion Service and medical director at Oregon Health & Science University.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The FDA is also considering requiring testing of all blood donated in areas where there was even one locally transmitted malaria case recently, but the committee members seemed less sure about this idea.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Committee member Dr. Sanjay Ahuja, director of Rainbow Hemostasis & Thrombosis Center at Rainbow Babies & Childrenâs Hospital in Cleveland, said that if there is proven local transmission, the decision of ï»¿when to test all donor blood from the area is a âdifficult one.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThere are so many nuances to this,â Ahuja said. âI think it might be a little bit much in my opinion, but I donât know whether more evidence of local transmission should be in place before we say âyesâ to this.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            During the meetingâs public comment period, leaders of someï»¿ blood supply organizations encouraged the FDA to take a cautious approach to changing the guidelines.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Ralph Vassallo, incoming chair of the Association for the Advancement of Blood & BiotherapiesÂ Transfusion Transmitted Disease Committee, said his group joinsï»¿ Americaâs Blood Centers and the American Red Cross in believing that the new test for malaria holds real promise to improve blood safety and may improve the availability of donors by removing âunnecessary donor deferrals,â particularly among subsets of donors with uncommon blood types, such as those from Latin American, Asian and African countries.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            But, he told the committee, there are no clinical studies that show that the test reduces the risk of transfusion-transmitted malaria.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Vassallo also encouraged the FDA to use flexible testing strategies and said that although the groups supported limited testing of all donations in ZIP codes with local malaria transmission, one case should not be enough to trigger such testing.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âFDA should support formal modeling studies designed in consultation with malariologists using the best available assumptions about parasite levels during asymptomatic infection before issuing final guidance,â he said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The committee did not vote on the proposed strategies, but the FDA said it would take the discussion into consideration as it considered changing its guidance.\n",

      "     \n",
      "            âAll of the vending machines have technology associated with it that ping us when theyâre getting low. So if theyâre at 50% capacity, we get the staff ready to activate the restockers,â Hayes said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThese vending machines that we have active right now have about 11,000 boxes of naloxone that have been distributed,â he said, and each box contains two doses.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The vending machines each hold 100 naloxone kits and 54 fentanyl test strip packages. Both items â naloxone and the test strips â are available in the machines free of charge. Typically, an over-the-counter box of two single-dose naloxone sprays can cost around $45.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In 2022, before the launch of the vending machine program, about 700 people died of opioid overdose in Oklahoma, according to state health department numbers, up from about 400 deaths in 2021. Hayes said the state will closely watch those numbers to see whether they decline over time, especially as naloxone becomes more easily accessible with the addition of more vending machines.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âOur goal is to get naloxone in the hands of every Oklahoman, because we want to normalize that naloxone is something that every person should carry on them,â Hayes said before he left the department.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âOur ultimate goal is to have naloxone in 2 million-plus peopleâs hands that are 18 and older,â he said. âPeople who are overdosing canât use this medication on themselves, and for about 40% of the people who overdose, thereâs a bystander around. So itâs critical that you have naloxone on you, because you never know when you can save a life.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Aside from providing naloxone and fentanyl test strips at no cost, an appeal of the vending machines is that they offer a sense of anonymity. The machines do not collect any identifiable information, and anyone can walk up and use them.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Hayes said there is still a lot of stigma around opioid use and the need for naloxone, but he hopes the vending machines can help reduce it. The machines have large print on the sides that reads ânaloxone saves lives.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âNot often do you see a vending machine that says âNaloxone can save livesâ and it be very mental health- and addiction-focused, at your gas station,â Hayes said. âThatâs another piece to this, is that we have a physical symbol of anti-stigma in places that typically arenât associated with the mental health field.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Some critics question whether the machines enable dangerous behaviors. Naloxone vending machine programs often can faceÂ opposition from the communitiesÂ where they are placed. But public health advocates champion the machines as a way to reduce the number of lives lost to overdose while reducing stigma.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In central Pennsylvania, six naloxone vending machines have been installed in rural communities where stigma can be prevalent but there is a greater need for expanded access to naloxone medication, said Carla Sofronski, executive director and co-founder of theÂ Pennsylvania Harm Reduction Network.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âHarm reduction is often highly stigmatized, especially in Pennsylvania, with the thought process that it is enabling drug use, when itâs actually quite the opposite. Harm reduction does not condone drug use. It just provides life-saving interventions and tools in a toolbox to keep people alive and minimize risk,â Sofronski said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âWe have to start treating this as an urgent public health crisis, and folks should not be denied access to life-saving interventions due to stigma or because some folks may believe that people have addiction due to moral failure,â she said. âWe need to cut the stigma to actually get these tools out to people.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Hall has faced stigma firsthand. He says he has heard some criticisms or âdifficultâ questions about the naloxone vending machines and other programs. For instance, people might ask whether the vending machines enable opioid abuse on-site.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âI donât think itâs realistic to think that somebodyâs going to walk into one of these spaces and see that this vending machine has fentanyl test strips and Narcan and think, âoh, this makes it safe for me to use.â I think if anything, itâs bringing more to the forefront the danger around using these substances,â Hall said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIt really is a shame that, a lot of times, we have to spend our time and energy into humanizing people that use substances or people that might need access to these tools,â he said. âThereâs some people that have the attitude of âwell, if somebody overdoses, then thatâs their problem,â and thatâs really unfortunate.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Some of these negative biases and attitudes around people with substance use disorders remind Hall of how easily stigma can chip away at someoneâs self-worth.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            If he could speak to his younger self, at the peak of his substance use, he would tell himself that he is worthy of all that life has to offer.\n",

      "            Even though he knows that naloxone is accessible through the vending machines, he always keeps some on him too, just in case.\n",

      "            âSometimes, you donât know when youâre going to need these products. A lot of times, substance use isnât planned,â he said. âSometimes, people are out in the community and maybe having a few cocktails and a substance becomes available, and maybe itâs a substance you typically wouldnât use, but youâve had a couple drinks, and your inhibitions are lowered.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            More than 111,000 people in the US died from a drug overdose in the 12-month period that ended in September, according toÂ provisional dataÂ from the US Centers for Disease Control and Preventionâs National Center for Health Statistics.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âWhen weâre talking about overdose death rates, Iâve got any number of friends, I see their face every time I see those numbers or when we talk about the number of overdose reversals that come from kits that are distributed by our community partners,â Hall said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âWhen I hear those numbers, I hear the voices of my friends that are currently struggling with substance use disorder,â he said, eyes filling with tears. âItâs very real to me.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Overall, the number of overdose deaths associated with any drug continues to increase each month in the United States, although the pace appears to be slowing. Deaths reached a record high in May and changed little in the following months, through September.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âPeople are dying every minute of the day due to these overdoses, and so the vending machines are an amazing tool to help get the help into the hands of the public,â said Lori Tremmel Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThis is a prevention technique, and itâs very, very helpful to have these distribution points in the community that allow people to get what they need quickly without necessarily relying immediately on a first responder when seconds matter to save a life,â she said. âAnd so these distribution points and these vending access machines are meant to bringÂ the solutions closer to the community and put the tools in their hands to save lives.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            A study conducted in Cincinnati found that a single vending machine was directly associated with reversing overdoses for at least 78 people in its first year.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In Clark County, Nevada, another study found that in the 12 months after the launch of naloxone vending machines, there were 229 opioid-involved overdose deaths. But researchers had previously predicted that there would be about 270 deaths in the county, suggesting that about 41 deaths were averted after the machines were launched.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Oklahomaâs naloxone vending machine program launched in June. The state placed its first machine at a homeless shelter in Tulsa.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The machines have become so popular that they need to be restocked every day, said Heath Hayes, former deputy commissioner for the state Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âAll of the vending machines have technology associated with it that ping us when theyâre getting low. So if theyâre at 50% capacity, we get the staff ready to activate the restockers,â Hayes said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âThese vending machines that we have active right now have about 11,000 boxes of naloxone that have been distributed,â he said, and each box contains two doses.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            The vending machines each hold 100 naloxone kits and 54 fentanyl test strip packages. Both items â naloxone and the test strips â are available in the machines free of charge. Typically, an over-the-counter box of two single-dose naloxone sprays can cost around $45.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In 2022, before the launch of the vending machine program, about 700 people died of opioid overdose in Oklahoma, according to state health department numbers, up from about 400 deaths in 2021. Hayes said the state will closely watch those numbers to see whether they decline over time, especially as naloxone becomes more easily accessible with the addition of more vending machines.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âOur goal is to get naloxone in the hands of every Oklahoman, because we want to normalize that naloxone is something that every person should carry on them,â Hayes said before he left the department.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âOur ultimate goal is to have naloxone in 2 million-plus peopleâs hands that are 18 and older,â he said. âPeople who are overdosing canât use this medication on themselves, and for about 40% of the people who overdose, thereâs a bystander around. So itâs critical that you have naloxone on you, because you never know when you can save a life.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Aside from providing naloxone and fentanyl test strips at no cost, an appeal of the vending machines is that they offer a sense of anonymity. The machines do not collect any identifiable information, and anyone can walk up and use them.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Hayes said there is still a lot of stigma around opioid use and the need for naloxone, but he hopes the vending machines can help reduce it. The machines have large print on the sides that reads ânaloxone saves lives.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âNot often do you see a vending machine that says âNaloxone can save livesâ and it be very mental health- and addiction-focused, at your gas station,â Hayes said. âThatâs another piece to this, is that we have a physical symbol of anti-stigma in places that typically arenât associated with the mental health field.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Some critics question whether the machines enable dangerous behaviors. Naloxone vending machine programs often can faceÂ opposition from the communitiesÂ where they are placed. But public health advocates champion the machines as a way to reduce the number of lives lost to overdose while reducing stigma.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            In central Pennsylvania, six naloxone vending machines have been installed in rural communities where stigma can be prevalent but there is a greater need for expanded access to naloxone medication, said Carla Sofronski, executive director and co-founder of theÂ Pennsylvania Harm Reduction Network.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âHarm reduction is often highly stigmatized, especially in Pennsylvania, with the thought process that it is enabling drug use, when itâs actually quite the opposite. Harm reduction does not condone drug use. It just provides life-saving interventions and tools in a toolbox to keep people alive and minimize risk,â Sofronski said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âWe have to start treating this as an urgent public health crisis, and folks should not be denied access to life-saving interventions due to stigma or because some folks may believe that people have addiction due to moral failure,â she said. âWe need to cut the stigma to actually get these tools out to people.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Hall has faced stigma firsthand. He says he has heard some criticisms or âdifficultâ questions about the naloxone vending machines and other programs. For instance, people might ask whether the vending machines enable opioid abuse on-site.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âI donât think itâs realistic to think that somebodyâs going to walk into one of these spaces and see that this vending machine has fentanyl test strips and Narcan and think, âoh, this makes it safe for me to use.â I think if anything, itâs bringing more to the forefront the danger around using these substances,â Hall said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âIt really is a shame that, a lot of times, we have to spend our time and energy into humanizing people that use substances or people that might need access to these tools,â he said. âThereâs some people that have the attitude of âwell, if somebody overdoses, then thatâs their problem,â and thatâs really unfortunate.â\n",
      "     \n",
      "            Some of these negative biases and attitudes around people with substance use disorders remind Hall of how easily stigma can chip away at someoneâs self-worth.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            If he could speak to his younger self, at the peak of his substance use, he would tell himself that he is worthy of all that life has to offer.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âI would tell little baby Jason that everything is going to be OK,â Hall said.\n",
      "     \n",
      "            âYou are not a broken person, and you are not less than anybody else, and you are not less deserving of everything that life has to offer,â he said. âAll these things about yourself that you think make yourself so different and so âotheredâ really just make you so much more human.â\n",

      "  Ammamellen avait une sœur et, toutes les fois qu'elle mettait au monde un garçon, il le tuait.Les choses se passèrent ainsi jusqu'à ce qu'un jour, ayant accouché en même temps que sa servante, la sœur d'Ammamellen lui donna son fils et prit avec elle l'enfant de cette dernière.Ammamellen vint, saisit cet enfant et le tua. Le fils de la femme libre resta chez la servante ; il grandit et devint homme.Il s'appelait Élias.Il n'est rien qu'Ammamellen, qui n'était pas dupe de la supercherie, ne tentât pour attirer Élias dans un piège et le tuer. Mais le garçon était plus rusé que lui et il ne put accomplir ses projets de meurtre.Un jour, Élias se rendit chez Ammamellen ; il avait très soif et Ammamellen tenait secret le lieu où l'on trouvait de l'eau dans la montagne. Le sol de la montagne était de roche dure et ne conservait pas l'empreinte des pieds.Ammamellen allait la nuit avec ses serviteurs faire boire les troupeaux et rentrait pendant que tout le monde dormait encore.Élias prit alors les souliers des serviteurs et les enduisit de graisse.Le lendemain, il suivit leurs traces. Là où les souliers avaient touché le rocher, ils avaient laissé de la graisse. Le garçon put ainsi arriver jusqu'à l'eau. Ammamellen l'avait vu et le suivait.  Au moment où Élias, penché au-dessus de l'eau, s'apprêtait à boire, il aperçut l'image d'Ammamellen qui tirait son sabre et allait l'en frapper sur la nuque. Il eut juste le temps de s'élancer et de s'enfuir de l'autre côté.Un autre jour, Ammamellen marcha jusqu'à une vallée et, avec des pattes d'animaux morts, il y fit des traces de chamelles, de chèvres, de brebis et d'ânes. Il y mit aussi trois vieux chameaux : l'un borgne, l'autre galeux et le troisième ayant la queue coupée.Il rentra chez lui et, le lendemain, il proposa à Élias, en échange de sa tranquillité : « Va visiter cette vallée au loin, tu nous diras ce qu'il s'y trouve. »Élias se rendit dans la vallée et, lorsqu'il fut de retour, Ammamellen lui demanda : « Eh bien, as-tu visité cette vallée ?— Oui, répondit Élias, je l'ai visitée. — Et que s'y trouve-t-il ? Le pays te plaît-il, oui ou non ?— Il me plaît, seulement il y a des traces d'animaux morts et trois vieux chameaux dont l'un est borgne, l'autre galeux et le troisième a la queue coupée.— Comment distingues-tu la trace d'un animal vivant d'un animal mort ?— La trace d'un animal vivant revient sur elle-même, tandis que celle d'un animal mort ne revient pas.— À quoi reconnais-tu qu'un vieux chameau est borgne ou qu'il a ses deux yeux ?— Le chameau borgne mange toujours les arbres du côté de son bon œil.— Et le chameau galeux ?— On reconnaît un chameau galeux parce qu'il se gratte à tous les arbres qu'il rencontre.— Et qu'est-ce qui te fait distinguer un chameau dont la queue est coupée de celui qui a sa queue ?— Lorsqu'un chameau qui n'a pas de queue vient à fienter, les crottes restent en tas, tandis que celui qui a sa queue s'en sert pour les disperser. »  Quelque temps plus tard, Ammamellenn, qui ne s'avouait pas vaincu, alla dans un certain endroit et ramassa beaucoup d'herbes dont il fit plusieurs tas. Il revint et dit à Élias :« Demain, tu iras à tel endroit et tu rapporteras l'herbe que j'y ai mise en tas. » Le lendemain, Ammamellen prit les devants et se blottit dans un tas d'herbe, attendant Élias pour le tuer.Celui-ci vint et rassembla toute l'herbe, excepté un tas dont il ne voulut pas s'approcher. Ses compagnons l'interrogèrent : « Tu as rassemblé tous les tas d'herbe, pourquoi laisses-tu celui-là ? — Celui-là respire, dit Élias ; les autres ne respirent pas. » En entendant cela, Ammamellen se leva précipitamment, saisit son javelot et le lança contre Élias qu'il manqua. Il s'écria alors : « Va, je m'incline devant toi, fils de ma sœur, que ma sœur a enfanté et qu'elle a fait enfanter à sa servante. » Et, depuis ce jour, Élias peut vivre près de sa mère en toute tranquillité.  L'histoire que tu viens de lire est un conte berbère.Le mot « berbère » désigne les premiers peuples habitant le nord de l'Afrique.

      "  Un jeune homme du nom de Mamadou, qui voulait apprendre à lire et à écrire, partit un jour à la recherche d'une école. Il quitta sa province pour se rendre dans la région du Kayor, au Sénégal. Là vivait un savant qui enseignait aux enfants. Mamadou resta auprès de son maître aussi longtemps que nécessaire. Quand il sut lire et écrire parfaitement, il décida de rentrer chez lui. Le jour de son départ, un camarade de classe, qui appartenait à l'espèce des génies, lui dit : « Nous sommes amis. Puisque tu t'en retournes chez toi, je vais te charger d'un message pour mes parents et je te transporterai dans ton village à la vitesse de l'éclair. Tu ne sais pas qui je suis, mais moi je te connais bien, car nous sommes nés au même endroit. Nous autres, les génies, nous vous reconnaissons très bien mais vous, les humains, vous ne pouvez pas nous apercevoir. Quand tu seras chez toi, mets à ton doigt cette bague d'argent, et tu pourras voir les génies et leurs villages. Si tu l'ôtes ou si tu la perds, tout disparaîtra de nouveau. »Le génie demanda ensuite à Mamadou de s'asseoir sur son tapis et de fermer les yeux. À peine Mamadou avait-il obéi qu'il se retrouva, comme par magie, dans son village. Le lendemain matin, Mamadou passa la bague à son doigt. Il aperçut alors tous les génies et leurs villages. Il alla rendre visite à la famille de son camarade.  « Le génie, votre parent, vous envoie le bonjour, leur dit-il.— Et où est-il, notre cher enfant ? lui demanda-t-on.— Je l'ai laissé dans un village du Kayor. Il continue de fréquenter l'école.— Ah, s'écrièrent les parents, notre brave petit se conduit bien ! Et toi, Mamadou, il faut que tu t'en retournes chez toi, mais, chaque fois que tu auras du temps libre, ne manque pas de venir nous voir. » Mamadou s'en retourna chez ses parents, mais, chaque fois qu'il en avait l'occasion, il rendait de longues visites aux génies. C'est qu'il avait vu la sœur de son camarade, Anta, une jolie demoiselle, et qu'il désirait l'épouser. Lorsqu'il lui fit sa déclaration, Anta répondit : « Je ne demande pas mieux ! Pourtant, j'hésite à me marier avec un être humain… Vous êtes si coléreux ! Et si bavards ! Et vous mentez si facilement ! Chez nous, il n'en va pas de même : jamais un génie ne s'emporte, jamais il ne trahit un secret ; il ne parle que pour dire la vérité. » Mamadou protesta :« Quand nous serons mariés, tu verras que, moi non plus, je ne m'emporte pas et que jamais je ne mens !— S'il en est ainsi, le mariage est conclu ! Je t'accepte pour mari. Mais je te défends de révéler à quiconque que tu as épousé une femme de l'espèce des génies !— C'est entendu ! promit Mamadou.— Eh bien, déclara Anta, nous pouvons célébrer notre mariage. » Depuis, Anta et Mamadou vivaient heureux.  Mais un jour qu'Anta avait quitté à l'aube le village pour se rendre dans sa famille, Mamadou se réveilla pour constater que, pendant la nuit, son grenier de mil avait pris feu, son pur-sang était mort, et son puissant taureau était tombé au fond du puits. Mamadou, et toute sa famille avec lui, était désespéré. Anta revint en fin de journée. En s'approchant de la case de son mari, elle entendit la mère de celui-ci se lamenter : « En un seul jour, voilà ton grenier de mil dévoré par les flammes ! Ton cheval de race meurt ! Puis c'est ton grand taureau – un taureau de cinq ans ! – qui périt aussi ! Cette maison va être ruinée dans peu de temps ! Cela devait arriver ! C'est la conséquence de ton mariage avec une femme de l'espèce des génies ! » À ces paroles, Anta décida de retourner dans sa famille. Mais avant de disparaître, elle suivit Mamadou jusqu'aux champs et, lorsqu'il s'endormit pour la sieste, elle lui ôta sa bague d'argent. À son réveil, Mamadou ne pouvait plus apercevoir les génies ni leurs villages. Il essaya de suivre le chemin qui menait chez Anta, en vain. Le village avait disparu.  Un beau jour, Anta revint dans le village de Mamadou. Elle trouva celui-ci endormi, et le réveilla. Il s'écria :« Anta ? ! D'où viens-tu ?— Je viens de mon village.— Ce n'est pas vrai ! Vous l'avez tous quitté !— Non. Nous l'habitons toujours.— Alors pourquoi ne vivons-nous plus comme autrefois ?— C'est qu'à présent notre mariage est rompu de par ma volonté !— Pourquoi l'as-tu rompu ?— Parce que tu n'as pas tenu ta promesse ! Quand tu m'as demandé de devenir ta femme, ne t'ai-je pas déclaré qu'il me serait difficile de le rester parce que, vous autres humains, vous vous emportez, vous mentez et vous bavardez à tort et à travers ?— Et quand donc me suis-je emporté ? En quoi ai-je menti ? Pourquoi dis-tu que j'ai été bavard ?— Tu as eu la langue trop pendue.— Mais à quel propos ? Dis-le-moi enfin !— Souviens-toi du jour où ton grenier de mil fut consumé, où ton cheval est mort et ton grand taureau est tombé dans le puits. Tout cela, je ne l'ignorais pas ! Mais je suis partie pour ne plus revenir, car j'ai entendu ta mère se plaindre de moi, ce qui est la preuve que tu lui as révélé notre secret et que tu as trahi ta promesse. Je vais te raconter ce qui s'est réellement passé : j'étais restée près de toi jusqu'à l'aube. Azraël, l'ange de la mort aux bras parsemés d'yeux et portant un arbre sur la tête, est venu. Il voulait s'emparer de toi. Je l'ai repoussé et rejeté sur ton grenier de mil, qui a brûlé. Il a essayé alors d'emporter ta mère. Je l'ai jeté sur le cheval, qui s'est effondré sous son poids. Il s'est néanmoins entêté à rester, prêt à se venger sur ta sœur. Et moi, une troisième fois, je l'ai combattu et repoussé. Il est tombé sur le taureau, qui mourut en basculant dans le puits. Si je t'avais laissé mourir, ainsi que ta mère et ta sœur, que serait devenue ta maison ? Elle aurait été perdue ! Et si vous êtes tous encore en vie, ce fut grâce à l'incendie du grenier de mil, à la mort du cheval et à celle du taureau ! Ne vaut-il pas mieux que les choses se soient passées ainsi ? Tu m'as trahie, mais avant de te quitter pour toujours, je devais te révéler la vérité. »Et Anta s'en alla. Jamais Mamadou ne la revit.  SalutationsLorsqu'on dit « Salaam aleikoum ! », il faut répondre : « Aleikoum asalaam ! » C'est ainsi que les Sénégalais se saluent. Ils se demandent ensuite comment ça va, comment vont la famille, la santé, les récoltes, ou encore, si le voyage s'est bien passé… C'est une habitude. En général, ils répondent que « tout va bien » ! Musique !La reine des musiques sénégalaises est le mbalax. Sur des rythmes endiablés des tambours, difficile de tenir en place ! Des tout-petits aux grands-mères : tout le monde se met à danser, le sourire jusqu'aux oreilles !  Bonne pêcheEn fin d'après-midi, les villageois arrivent par dizaines sur les plages de Yoff. Pas question de rater le retour des pêcheurs ! À peine sorties des grosses vagues, les barques sont entourées par la foule. Chacun veut les plus beaux poissons. En quelques minutes, un marché s'improvise : une vraie pagaille ! Les enfants en profitent pour jouer au football… tandis que les chèvres se lèchent les babines en attendant les restes.  Dans quel pays se déroule l'histoire ?  Qu'est-ce que le mil ?  Quels sont les animaux que perd Mamadou ?  Mamadou ne revit plus jamais Anta, car :  Quel instrument de musique fait danser tous les Sénégalais ?  Quel sport les petits Sénégalais aiment-ils ?    Un jeune homme du nom de Mamadou, qui voulait apprendre à lire et à écrire, partit un jour à la recherche d'une école. Il quitta sa province pour se rendre dans la région du Kayor, au Sénégal. Là vivait un savant qui enseignait aux enfants. Mamadou resta auprès de son maître aussi longtemps que nécessaire. Quand il sut lire et écrire parfaitement, il décida de rentrer chez lui. Le jour de son départ, un camarade de classe, qui appartenait à l'espèce des génies, lui dit : « Nous sommes amis. Puisque tu t'en retournes chez toi, je vais te charger d'un message pour mes parents et je te transporterai dans ton village à la vitesse de l'éclair. Tu ne sais pas qui je suis, mais moi je te connais bien, car nous sommes nés au même endroit. Nous autres, les génies, nous vous reconnaissons très bien mais vous, les humains, vous ne pouvez pas nous apercevoir. Quand tu seras chez toi, mets à ton doigt cette bague d'argent, et tu pourras voir les génies et leurs villages. Si tu l'ôtes ou si tu la perds, tout disparaîtra de nouveau. »Le génie demanda ensuite à Mamadou de s'asseoir sur son tapis et de fermer les yeux. À peine Mamadou avait-il obéi qu'il se retrouva, comme par magie, dans son village. Le lendemain matin, Mamadou passa la bague à son doigt. Il aperçut alors tous les génies et leurs villages. Il alla rendre visite à la famille de son camarade.  « Le génie, votre parent, vous envoie le bonjour, leur dit-il.— Et où est-il, notre cher enfant ? lui demanda-t-on.— Je l'ai laissé dans un village du Kayor. Il continue de fréquenter l'école.— Ah, s'écrièrent les parents, notre brave petit se conduit bien ! Et toi, Mamadou, il faut que tu t'en retournes chez toi, mais, chaque fois que tu auras du temps libre, ne manque pas de venir nous voir. » Mamadou s'en retourna chez ses parents, mais, chaque fois qu'il en avait l'occasion, il rendait de longues visites aux génies. C'est qu'il avait vu la sœur de son camarade, Anta, une jolie demoiselle, et qu'il désirait l'épouser. Lorsqu'il lui fit sa déclaration, Anta répondit : « Je ne demande pas mieux ! Pourtant, j'hésite à me marier avec un être humain… Vous êtes si coléreux ! Et si bavards ! Et vous mentez si facilement ! Chez nous, il n'en va pas de même : jamais un génie ne s'emporte, jamais il ne trahit un secret ; il ne parle que pour dire la vérité. » Mamadou protesta :« Quand nous serons mariés, tu verras que, moi non plus, je ne m'emporte pas et que jamais je ne mens !— S'il en est ainsi, le mariage est conclu ! Je t'accepte pour mari. Mais je te défends de révéler à quiconque que tu as épousé une femme de l'espèce des génies !— C'est entendu ! promit Mamadou.— Eh bien, déclara Anta, nous pouvons célébrer notre mariage. » Depuis, Anta et Mamadou vivaient heureux.  Mais un jour qu'Anta avait quitté à l'aube le village pour se rendre dans sa famille, Mamadou se réveilla pour constater que, pendant la nuit, son grenier de mil avait pris feu, son pur-sang était mort, et son puissant taureau était tombé au fond du puits.

À son réveil, Mamadou ne pouvait plus apercevoir les génies ni leurs villages. Il essaya de suivre le chemin qui menait chez Anta, en vain. Le village avait disparu.  Un beau jour, Anta revint dans le village de Mamadou. Elle trouva celui-ci endormi, et le réveilla. Il s'écria :« Anta ? ! D'où viens-tu ?— Je viens de mon village.— Ce n'est pas vrai !

      "  Dans un village de la campagne russe vivait une petite fille qui n'avait plus de maman. Son père se remaria, mais il choisit une méchante femme. Elle détestait la petite fille et la traitait mal. « Comment faire pour me débarrasser de cette enfant ? » songeait la marâtre. Un jour que son mari s'était rendu au marché vendre du blé, elle dit à la petite fille : « Va chez ma sœur, ta gentille tante, et demande-lui une aiguille et du fil pour te coudre une chemise. »La petite fille mit son joli fichu rouge et partit. En route, elle se dit, comme elle était maligne : « J'irai d'abord demander conseil à ma vraie gentille tante, la sœur de ma vraie maman. » Sa tante la reçut avec bonté.« Tante, dit la petite fille, la nouvelle femme de papa m'a envoyée chez sa sœur lui demander une aiguille et du fil pour me coudre une chemise. Mais d'abord, je suis venue te demander, à toi, un bon conseil. – Tu as eu raison. La sœur de ta marâtre n'est autre que Baba-Yaga, la cruelle ogresse ! Mais écoute-moi : il y a dans son jardin un bouleau qui voudra te fouetter les yeux avec ses branches, noue un ruban autour de son tronc. Tu verras une grosse barrière qui grince et qui voudra se refermer toute seule, mets de l'huile sur ses gonds. Des chiens voudront te dévorer, jette-leur du pain. Enfin, tu verras un chat qui te crèverait les yeux, donne-lui un bout de jambon.– Merci bien, ma tante » répondit la petite fille. Elle marcha longtemps, puis arriva enfin à la maison de Baba-Yaga. Baba-Yaga était en train de tisser. « Bonjour ma tante.– Bonjour, ma nièce.– Ma mère m'envoie te demander une aiguille et du fil pour qu'elle me couse une chemise.– Bon, je m'en vais te chercher une aiguille bien droite et du fil bien blanc. En attendant, assieds-toi à ma place et tisse. »La petite fille se mit au métier. Elle était bien contente.  Soudain, elle entendit Baba-Yaga dire à sa servante dans la cour : « Chauffe le bain et lave ma nièce soigneusement. Je veux la manger au dîner. »La petite fille trembla de peur. Elle vit la servante entrer et apporter des bûches, des fagots et des seaux pleins d'eau. Alors elle s'efforça de prendre une voix aimable et gaie, et elle dit à la servante : « Hé, ma bonne, fends moins de bois, et pour apporter l'eau, sers-toi plutôt d'une passoire ! » Et elle lui donna son joli fichu rouge.La petite fille regarda tout autour d'elle. Un feu vif et clair commençait à flamber dans la cheminée, l'eau se mettait à chanter dans le chaudron, et bien que ce fût une eau d'ogresse, elle chantait une jolie chanson.Mais Baba-Yaga s'impatientait. De la cour, elle demanda : « Tu tisses, ma nièce ? Tu tisses, ma chérie ?– Je tisse, ma tante, je tisse. » Sans faire de bruit, la petite fille se leva, alla à la porte… Mais le chat était là, maigre, noir, effrayant ! De ses yeux verts il regarda les yeux bleus de la petite fille. Et déjà il sortait ses griffes pour les lui crever. Mais elle lui donna un morceau de jambon et lui demanda doucement : « Dis-moi, je t'en prie, comment je peux échapper à Baba-Yaga ? »Le chat mangea d'abord tout le morceau de jambon, puis il lissa ses moustaches et répondit : « Prends ce peigne et cette serviette, et sauve-toi. Baba-Yaga va te poursuivre. Colle l'oreille contre la terre, si tu l'entends approcher, jette la serviette, et tu verras ! Si elle te poursuit toujours, colle encore l'oreille contre la terre, et quand tu l'entendras sur la route, jette le peigne, et tu verras ! »La petite fille remercia le chat, prit la serviette et le peigne, et s'enfuit. Mais à peine sortie de la maison, elle vit deux chiens encore plus maigres que le chat, tout prêts à la dévorer. Elle leur jeta du pain tendre, et ils ne lui firent aucun mal. Ensuite, c'est la grosse barrière qui grinça et qui voulut se refermer pour l'empêcher de sortir de l'enclos. Mais comme sa tante le lui avait dit, elle lui versa toute une burette d'huile sur les gonds, et la barrière s'ouvrit largement pour la laisser passer. Sur le chemin, le bouleau siffla et s'agita pour lui fouetter les yeux. Mais elle noua un ruban rouge à son tronc, et le bouleau la salua et lui montra le chemin. Elle courut, elle courut, elle courut. Pendant ce temps, le chat s'était mis à tisser. De la cour, Baba-Yaga demanda encore une fois : « Tu tisses, ma nièce ? Tu tisses, ma chérie ?– Je tisse, ma vieille tante, je tisse, répondit le chat d'une grosse voix. »Furieuse, Baba-Yaga se précipita dans la maison. Plus de petite fille ! Elle rossa le chat et cria : « Pourquoi ne lui as-tu pas crevé les yeux, traître ? – Eh ! dit le chat. Voilà longtemps que je suis à ton service, et tu ne m'as jamais donné le plus petit os, tandis qu'elle m'a donné du jambon ! »Baba-Yaga rossa les chiens. « Eh ! dirent les chiens. Voilà longtemps que nous sommes à ton service, et nous as-tu seulement jeté une vieille croûte ? Tandis qu'elle nous a donné du pain tendre ! » Baba-Yaga secoua la barrière. « Eh ! dit la barrière. Voilà longtemps que je suis à ton service, et tu ne m'as jamais mis une seule goutte d'huile sur les gonds, tandis qu'elle m'en a versé une pleine burette ! » Baba-Yaga s'en prit au bouleau. « Eh ! dit le bouleau. Voilà longtemps que je suis à ton service, et tu ne m'as jamais décoré d'un fil, tandis qu'elle m'a paré d'un beau ruban de soie ! – Et moi, dit la servante, à qui pourtant on ne demandait rien, et moi, depuis le temps que je suis à ton service, je n'ai jamais reçu de toi ne serait-ce qu'une loque, tandis qu'elle m'a fait cadeau d'un joli fichu rouge ! » Baba-Yaga siffla son mortier, qui arriva ventre à terre, et elle sauta dedans. Jouant du pilon et effaçant ses traces avec son balai, elle s'élança à la poursuite de la petite fille, à travers la campagne. La petite fille colla son oreille contre la terre : elle entendit que Baba-Yaga approchait. Alors elle jeta la serviette qui se transforma en une large rivière ! Baba-Yaga fut bien obligée de s'arrêter. Elle grinça des dents, roula des yeux jaunes, courut à sa maison, fit sortir ses trois bœufs de l'étable et les amena près de la rivière. Et les bœufs burent toute l'eau jusqu'à la dernière goutte. Alors Baba-Yaga reprit sa poursuite.  La petite fille était loin. Elle colla l'oreille contre la terre. Elle entendit le pilon sur la route. Elle jeta le peigne qui se changea en une forêt touffue ! Baba-Yaga essaya d'y entrer, de scier les arbres avec ses dents. Impossible ! La petite fille écouta : plus rien. Elle n'entendit que le vent qui soufflait entre les sapins verts et noirs de la forêt.   Pourtant elle continua de courir très vite parce qu'il commençait à faire nuit, et elle pensait : « Mon papa doit me croire perdue. » Le vieux paysan, de retour du marché, avait demandé à sa femme : « Où est la petite ?– Qui le sait ! avait répondu la marâtre. Voilà des heures que je l'ai envoyée faire une commission chez sa tante. » Enfin, la petite fille, les joues toutes rouges d'avoir couru, arriva chez son père. Il lui demanda :« D'où viens-tu, ma petite ?– Ah ! dit-elle. Petit père, ma mère m'a envoyée chez ma tante chercher une aiguille et du fil pour me coudre une chemise, mais ma tante, figure-toi que c'est Baba-Yaga, la cruelle ogresse ! » Et elle raconta toute son histoire. Le vieil homme était très en colère. Il roua de coups la marâtre et la chassa de sa maison en lui ordonnant de ne plus jamais revenir. Depuis ce temps, la petite fille et son père vivent en paix. Je suis passée dans leur village, ils m'ont invitée à leur table, le repas était très bon et tout le monde était content. Saint-Pétersbourg : ville impérialeIl y a 300 ans, le tsar (empereur) Pierre le Grand décida de bâtir une nouvelle capitale russe, aussi belle que les villes d'Europe.Il fit donc venir des architectes et des artistes français, italiens, hollandais… Entre la mer et le fleuve Neva, de somptueux bâtiments blancs, verts et or s'élevèrent peu à peu.Plus tard, d'autres empereurs et impératrices continuèrent à remplir la ville de trésors…  Traverser le plus grand pays du mondeDe Moscou à Vladivostok, le Transsibérien parcourt plus de 9 000 km en 7 jours ! Le train traverse des villes, puis franchit les montagnes de l'Oural.De l'autre côté, le décor change. Et la température dégringole.Pour se réchauffer, rien de tel qu'une soupe de betterave !Les steppes (plaines) de Sibérie semblent sans fin… Seuls quelques villages apparaissent sur ce désert de neige. Pour pêcher, les habitants doivent creuser des trous dans les rivières gelées !Le train s'engouffre ensuite entre les montagnes pour contourner l'immense lac Baïkal : des tunnels et des ponts à n'en plus finir. Quel spectacle ! Il longe encore la Mongolie, puis la Chine.À Vladivostok : « Terminus, tout le monde descend ! »  Dans quel pays se déroule l'histoire ?  Que doit aller chercher la petite fille chez Baba-Yaga ?  Avant de se rendre chez Baba-Yaga, à qui la fillette va-t-elle demander conseil ?  Que lui révèle sa tante au sujet de Baba-Yaga ?  Pourquoi Baba-Yaga veut-elle laver la fillette ?  Tandis que Baba-Yaga parle à sa servante, la petite fille :  Alors que la fillette s'apprête à s'enfuir, qui rencontre-t-elle ?  Quel cadeau offre-t-elle au chat ?  Quels objets le chat lui donne-t-il en échange ?  Pour ne pas être dévorée, la petite fille jette aux chiens :  Pourquoi les serviteurs de Baba-Yaga aident-ils la fillette à s'enfuir ?  La serviette se transforme en :  En quoi le peigne se change-t-il ?  Que devient la marâtre à la fin de l'histoire ?  Que mangent les russes pour se réchauffer ?  Comment s'appelle le train qui traverse la Russie ?  Qui décida de bâtir la ville de Saint-Pétersbourg ?    Dans un village de la campagne russe vivait une petite fille qui n'avait plus de maman. Son père se remaria, mais il choisit une méchante femme. Elle détestait la petite fille et la traitait mal. « Comment faire pour me débarrasser de cette enfant ? » songeait la marâtre.

Un feu vif et clair commençait à flamber dans la cheminée, l'eau se mettait à chanter dans le chaudron, et bien que ce fût une eau d'ogresse, elle chantait une jolie chanson.Mais Baba-Yaga s'impatientait. De la cour, elle demanda : « Tu tisses, ma nièce ? Tu tisses, ma chérie ?– Je tisse, ma tante, je tisse. » Sans faire de bruit, la petite fille se leva, alla à la porte… Mais le chat était là, maigre, noir, effrayant ! De ses yeux verts il regarda les yeux bleus de la petite fille. Et déjà il sortait ses griffes pour les lui crever. Mais elle lui donna un morceau de jambon et lui demanda doucement : « Dis-moi, je t'en prie, comment je peux échapper à Baba-Yaga ? »Le chat mangea d'abord tout le morceau de jambon, puis il lissa ses moustaches et répondit : « Prends ce peigne et cette serviette, et sauve-toi. Baba-Yaga va te poursuivre. Colle l'oreille contre la terre, si tu l'entends approcher, jette la serviette, et tu verras ! Si elle te poursuit toujours, colle encore l'oreille contre la terre, et quand tu l'entendras sur la route, jette le peigne, et tu verras ! »La petite fille remercia le chat, prit la serviette et le peigne, et s'enfuit. Mais à peine sortie de la maison, elle vit deux chiens encore plus maigres que le chat, tout prêts à la dévorer. Elle leur jeta du pain tendre, et ils ne lui firent aucun mal. Ensuite, c'est la grosse barrière qui grinça et qui voulut se refermer pour l'empêcher de sortir de l'enclos. Mais comme sa tante le lui avait dit, elle lui versa toute une burette d'huile sur les gonds, et la barrière s'ouvrit largement pour la laisser passer. Sur le chemin, le bouleau siffla et s'agita pour lui fouetter les yeux. Mais elle noua un ruban rouge à son tronc, et le bouleau la salua et lui montra le chemin. Elle courut, elle courut, elle courut. Pendant ce temps, le chat s'était mis à tisser. De la cour, Baba-Yaga demanda encore une fois : « Tu tisses, ma nièce ? Tu tisses, ma chérie ?– Je tisse, ma vieille tante, je tisse, répondit le chat d'une grosse voix. »Furieuse, Baba-Yaga se précipita dans la maison. Plus de petite fille ! Elle rossa le chat et cria : « Pourquoi ne lui as-tu pas crevé les yeux, traître ? – Eh ! dit le chat. Voilà longtemps que je suis à ton service, et tu ne m'as jamais donné le plus petit os, tandis qu'elle m'a donné du jambon ! »Baba-Yaga rossa les chiens. « Eh ! dirent les chiens. Voilà longtemps que nous sommes à ton service, et nous as-tu seulement jeté une vieille croûte ? Tandis qu'elle nous a donné du pain tendre ! » Baba-Yaga secoua la barrière. « Eh ! dit la barrière. Voilà longtemps que je suis à ton service, et tu ne m'as jamais mis une seule goutte d'huile sur les gonds, tandis qu'elle m'en a versé une pleine burette ! » Baba-Yaga s'en prit au bouleau. « Eh ! dit le bouleau. Voilà longtemps que je suis à ton service, et tu ne m'as jamais décoré d'un fil, tandis qu'elle m'a paré d'un beau ruban de soie ! – Et moi, dit la servante, à qui pourtant on ne demandait rien, et moi, depuis le temps que je suis à ton service, je n'ai jamais reçu de toi ne serait-ce qu'une loque, tandis qu'elle m'a fait cadeau d'un joli fichu rouge ! » Baba-Yaga siffla son mortier, qui arriva ventre à terre, et elle sauta dedans. Jouant du pilon et effaçant ses traces avec son balai, elle s'élança à la poursuite de la petite fille, à travers la campagne. La petite fille colla son oreille contre la terre : elle entendit que Baba-Yaga approchait. Alors elle jeta la serviette qui se transforma en une large rivière ! Baba-Yaga fut bien obligée de s'arrêter. Elle grinça des dents, roula des yeux jaunes, courut à sa maison, fit sortir ses trois bœufs de l'étable et les amena près de la rivière. Et les bœufs burent toute l'eau jusqu'à la dernière goutte. Alors Baba-Yaga reprit sa poursuite.  La petite fille était loin. Elle colla l'oreille contre la terre. Elle entendit le pilon sur la route. Elle jeta le peigne qui se changea en une forêt touffue ! Baba-Yaga essaya d'y entrer, de scier les arbres avec ses dents. Impossible ! La petite fille écouta : plus rien. Elle n'entendit que le vent qui soufflait entre les sapins verts et noirs de la forêt.   Pourtant elle continua de courir très vite parce qu'il commençait à faire nuit, et elle pensait : « Mon papa doit me croire perdue. » Le vieux paysan, de retour du marché, avait demandé à sa femme : « Où est la petite ?– Qui le sait ! avait répondu la marâtre. Voilà des heures que je l'ai envoyée faire une commission chez sa tante. » Enfin, la petite fille, les joues toutes rouges d'avoir couru, arriva chez son père. Il lui demanda :« D'où viens-tu, ma petite ?– Ah ! dit-elle. Petit père, ma mère m'a envoyée chez ma tante chercher une aiguille et du fil pour me coudre une chemise, mais ma tante, figure-toi que c'est Baba-Yaga, la cruelle ogresse ! » Et elle raconta toute son histoire. Le vieil homme était très en colère. Il roua de coups la marâtre et la chassa de sa maison en lui ordonnant de ne plus jamais revenir. Depuis ce temps, la petite fille et son père vivent en paix. Je suis passée dans leur village, ils m'ont invitée à leur table, le repas était très bon et tout le monde était content.\n",

      "  Il était une fois une famille pauvre qui comptait trois fils : Pierre, Jacques et Jean. Un jour, Pierre, l'aîné, dit : « Je vais aller chercher du travail ; je reviendrai quand je serai riche. » Il partit sur la grand-route et marcha, marcha. Un soir, n'ayant plus qu'un croûton de pain à se mettre sous la dent, il rencontra une vieille qui lui demanda : « Voulez-vous m'indiquer le chemin pour aller à Châteauguay ? » Pierre la renseigna, puis elle dit : « Avez-vous quelque chose à donner à une vieille pauvresse ? » Pierre lui donna son croûton de pain. La vieille l'accepta et lui dit :« Je suis une fée. Pour te remercier de ta gentillesse, voici une nappe blanche. Tu n'auras qu'à dire : \"Nappe, mets la table !\", et aussitôt des mets de toutes sortes s'y déposeront tout seuls. — Oh, merci, merci ! » fit Pierre, s'empressant de reprendre la route en direction de chez ses parents. Il marcha, marcha d'un bon pas, mais la nuit arriva. Il était fatigué, alors il s'arrêta dans une auberge. Avant de dormir, comme il avait faim, il sortit sa nappe et commanda : « Nappe, mets la table ! » Aussitôt la nappe se déplia sous ses yeux et se couvrit de mets succulents et de fruits appétissants. Mais l'aubergiste avait vu le manège et, dans la nuit, il vola la nappe qu'il remplaça par une autre identique.Le lendemain matin, Pierre quitta l'auberge et fila vers sa maison.  « Voyez, s'empressa-t-il de dire à ses parents, je rapporte une nappe merveilleuse qui se couvre de mets et de fruits délicieux. Vous allez voir ! »Il sortit la nappe blanche de son sac et lança : « Nappe, mets la table ! » Mais la nappe resta pliée et rien n'apparut. Alors Pierre la saisit, la déplia, l'examina et constata que ce n'était pas la sienne. « Ce doit être l'aubergiste qui me l'a volée ! » s'écria-t-il, tout penaud. Alors, l'un de ses frères, Jacques, annonça tout à coup : « Moi aussi, je pars chercher du travail. Et je retrouverai bien la nappe de Pierre. »  À son tour, il marcha, marcha. Il arriva un bon matin au bord d'une rivière sans beaucoup d'eau où était assise une vieille femme toute courbée par l'âge. Le voyant approcher, elle l'interpella : « Voulez-vous m'aider à traverser la rivière ? » Jacques y consentit sans hésiter. Arrivée sur l'autre rive, la vieille lui dit : « Je suis une fée. Pour te récompenser de m'avoir secourue, je te donne cette poule. » Et elle sortit une poule de sous son manteau, ajoutant : « Dis : \"Poule, ponds-moi de l'or !\" et elle pondra de l'or. » Enchanté, Jacques remercia la vieille et s'empressa de rentrer chez ses parents. Il marcha longtemps et finit par s'arrêter pour dormir à l'auberge où son frère Pierre avait fait halte. Il monta à sa chambre et dit à sa poule : « Poule, ponds-moi de l'or ! » Et la poule pondit trois œufs d'or. Pour payer sa dépense, il en donna un à l'aubergiste qui eut des doutes sur sa provenance. Durant la nuit, ce dernier alla dans la chambre où dormait son client, vit la poule et la vola. Il la remplaça par une autre en tout point semblable. Le lendemain, Jacques arriva à la maison tout joyeux en disant : « Voyez ma jolie poule ; elle pond de l'or ! Regardez bien ! » Il posa sa poule sur la table et dit : « Poule, ponds-moi de l'or ! » Tout ce que fit la poule ce fut de branler la tête et de chanter : « Caque-caque-canette. » Jacques était bien peiné. Il s'écria : « Ah, c'est le vilain aubergiste qui m'a volé ma poule ! » Alors, Jean, le plus jeune des trois frères, dit : « C'est à mon tour de tenter ma chance. Je pars chercher fortune. »  Comme ses frères avant lui, il marcha, marcha sur le chemin. Puis, à la tombée du jour, il arriva à l'orée d'un grand bois où se tenait une vieille femme, qui lui dit : « Mon cher petit, voulez-vous m'aider à traverser ce bois ? Il fait bien noir, et j'ai peur des voleurs.— Volontiers », dit Jean.Il prit alors la main de la vieille et la conduisit de l'autre côté du bois. Arrivée là, la vieille se redressa et déclara : « Je suis une fée. Pour te récompenser de ta gentillesse, je te fais cadeau de ce bâton. Tu n'auras qu'à dire : \"Bâton, tape !\", et aussitôt il se mettra à taper sur qui tu voudras. »Jean était enchanté. Il remercia la fée et se dirigea bien vite vers la maison où l'attendaient ses frères et ses parents. Mais la nuit tomba, et Jean était fatigué. Il s'arrêta dormir à l'auberge, la même où ses frères avaient fait halte. Après une bonne nuit de repos, il demanda à l'aubergiste :« C'est vous qui avez volé la nappe de mon frère, la nappe qui met la table ?— Jamais de la vie ! répliqua l'aubergiste. Je n'ai rien volé du tout !— Vous allez me la rendre ou je vous fais cogner par mon bâton, dit Jean.— Je n'ai rien à vous rendre, protesta le bonhomme.— Soit ! fit Jean. Alors, bâton, tape ! »Aussitôt le bâton s'abattit sur les épaules de l'aubergiste. Bang ! Bing ! Pan, pan ! L'aubergiste se sauva en se lamentant et en criant :« Arrêtez ! Arrêtez votre bâton ! »— Pas tant que vous ne m'aurez pas rendu la nappe de mon frère », répondit Jean.Le corps meurtri, l'aubergiste sortit enfin la nappe blanche du buffet et la donna à Jean qui arrêta son bâton. Puis, le jeune homme s'en alla sur le chemin. Mais, le soir même, le voici de retour demandant asile pour la nuit. Et le lendemain matin, il dit à l'aubergiste : « Maintenant, rendez-moi la poule que vous avez volée à mon frère.— Je n'ai pas volé de poule ! protesta l'aubergiste.— Si vous ne me la rendez pas, je vous fais cogner par mon bâton.— Non, non ! Je n'ai pas ta poule ! » hurla l'aubergiste en se sauvant, car il avait très peur des coups de bâton. Jean lança : « Bâton, tape ! » Le bâton courut après le bonhomme, lui sauta sur le dos et lui tapa sur les épaules. Le bâton tapa. Bing ! Bang ! Pan, pan ! Le vilain aubergiste cria et se roula par terre, mais le bâton continuait de taper. Bing ! Bang ! Pan, pan ! N'en pouvant plus de douleur, l'aubergiste alla chercher la poule et la remit à Jean, qui arrêta son bâton et reprit la route. En chemin, il rencontra trois voleurs qui lui dirent :« Donne ta poule et tous tes biens, sinon nous te pendrons à la plus haute branche de cet arbre.— Laissez-moi passer, dit Jean, ou je vous fais massacrer par les coups de mon bâton.— Ha, ha ! dirent les voleurs, riant de ses menaces. Nous allons te pendre !— Bâton, tape ! » cria alors Jean.Et le bâton s'abattit comme la grêle sur les épaules des voleurs. Bing ! Bang ! Pan, pan ! Les voleurs épouvantés s'enfuirent, poursuivis par le bâton déchaîné. Bing ! Bang ! Pan, Pan  ! Jean rappela son bâton et se remit en route. Il arriva chez ses parents et s'exclama joyeusement : « J'ai tout rapporté : la nappe, la poule, et mon bâton qui cogne quand je le veux. Voici la nappe. « Nappe, mets la table ! » lança Pierre. Aussitôt la nappe s'étala et se couvrit de mets et de fruits appétissants. Jean sortit la poule de son sac, et Jacques dit : « Poule, ponds-moi de l'or ! » Et la poule pondit trois œufs d'or. Ce fut alors, dans la pauvre demeure, une soirée de réjouissances agrémentée d'un festin de roi. Pierre, Jacques et Jean avaient vraiment fait fortune. Ils rendirent la vie douce à leurs parents, et tous les cinq vécurent heureux et contents jusqu'à la fin de leurs jours.  La poule est l'animal d'élevage le plus répandu dans le monde. Son ancêtre est un superbe oiseau de la jungle asiatique : le coq bankiva. La poule domestique ne peut pas voler : son corps est trop gros et ses ailes trop petites !  La poule pond des œufs dès l'âge de six mois, de 70 à 250 par an ! Elle couve ses œufs 3 semaines jusqu'à ce que le poussin sorte. Au 21e jour, le poussin brise sa coquille à l'aide d'une petite dent située au bout de son bec : « la dent de l'œuf ».  La poule reste au sol à picorer des graines, des vers de terre, des insectes et même des petits cailloux, qu'elle avale tout rond ! Elle se perche dans le poulailler juste pour la nuit.  La vieille dame est en réalité :  Qui vole les affaires de Pierre et de Jacques ?  Quelles sont les phrases magiques de l'histoire ?    Il était une fois une famille pauvre qui comptait trois fils : Pierre, Jacques et Jean. Un jour, Pierre, l'aîné, dit : « Je vais aller chercher du travail ; je reviendrai quand je serai riche. » Il partit sur la grand-route et marcha, marcha.

      "  Un jour de plein hiver, une reine était assise à sa fenêtre encadrée de bois d'ébène et cousait. Tout en tirant l'aiguille, elle regardait voler les blancs flocons. Elle se piqua au doigt et trois gouttes de sang tombèrent sur la neige. Ce rouge sur ce blanc faisait si bel effet qu'elle se dit : « Si seulement j'avais un enfant aussi blanc que la neige, aussi rose que le sang, aussi noir que le bois de ma fenêtre ! » Peu de temps après, une fille lui naquit ; elle était blanche comme neige, rose comme sang et ses cheveux étaient noirs comme de l'ébène. On l'appela Blanche-Neige.Mais la reine mourut en lui donnant le jour.  Au bout d'une année, le roi épousa une autre femme. Elle était très belle ; mais elle était fière et vaniteuse et ne pouvait souffrir que quelqu'un la surpassât en beauté. Elle possédait un miroir magique. Quand elle s'y regardait en disant : « Miroir, miroir joli, qui est la plus belle au pays ? » Le miroir répondait : « Madame la reine, vous êtes la plus belle au pays. » Et elle était contente. Elle savait que le miroir disait la vérité.Blanche-Neige, cependant, grandissait et devenait de plus en plus belle. Quand elle eut atteint ses dix-sept ans, elle était déjà plus jolie que le jour et plus belle que la reine elle-même. Un jour que celle-ci demandait au miroir : « Miroir, miroir joli, qui est la plus belle au pays ? » Celui-ci répondit : « Madame la reine, vous êtes la plus belle ici, mais Blanche-Neige est encore mille fois plus belle. » La reine en fut épouvantée. À partir de là, chaque fois qu'elle apercevait Blanche-Neige, son cœur se retournait dans sa poitrine tant elle éprouvait de haine à son égard. Elle en avait perdu le repos, le jour et la nuit. Elle fit venir un chasseur et lui dit : « Emmène l'enfant dans la forêt ! je ne veux plus la voir. Tue-la et rapporte-moi pour preuve de sa mort ses poumons et son foie. »Le chasseur obéit et conduisit Blanche-Neige dans le bois. Mais quand il eut dégainé son poignard pour en percer le cœur innocent de la jeune fille, celle-ci se mit à pleurer et dit : « Ô, cher chasseur, laisse-moi la vie ! Je m'enfoncerai au plus profond de la forêt et ne rentrerai jamais à la maison. »Le chasseur eut pitié d'elle et dit : « Sauve-toi, pauvre enfant ! » Mais il songeait : « Les bêtes de la forêt auront tôt fait de te dévorer ! » Un marcassin passait justement. Le chasseur le tua de son poignard, prit ses poumons et son foie et les apporta à la reine comme preuves de la mort de Blanche-Neige. Le cuisinier reçut ordre de les apprêter et la méchante femme les mangea, s'imaginant qu'ils avaient appartenu à Blanche-Neige. La pauvre petite, elle, était au milieu des bois, toute seule. Sa peur était si grande qu'elle regardait toutes les feuilles de la forêt sans savoir ce qu'elle allait devenir. Elle se mit à courir sur les cailloux pointus et à travers les épines. Les bêtes sauvages bondissaient autour d'elle, mais ne lui faisaient aucun mal. Elle courut jusqu'au soir, aussi longtemps que ses jambes purent la porter. Elle aperçut alors une petite maison et y pénétra pour s'y reposer. Dans la maisonnette, tout était minuscule, gracieux et propre. On y voyait une petite table couverte d'une nappe blanche, avec sept petites assiettes et sept petites cuillères, sept petites fourchettes et sept petits couteaux, et aussi sept petits gobelets. Contre le mur, il y avait sept petits lits alignés les uns à côté des autres et recouverts de draps tout blancs. Blanche-Neige avait si faim et si soif qu'elle prit dans chaque assiette un peu de légumes et de pain et but une goutte de vin dans chaque gobelet car elle ne voulait pas manger la portion tout entière de l'un des convives. Fatiguée, elle voulut ensuite se coucher. Mais aucun des lits ne lui convenait ; l'un était trop long, l'autre trop court. Elle les essaya tous. Le septième, enfin, fut à sa taille. Elle s'y allongea, se confia à Dieu et s'endormit. Quand la nuit fut complètement tombée, les propriétaires de la maisonnette arrivèrent. C'était sept nains qui, dans la montagne, travaillaient à la mine. Ils allumèrent leurs sept petites lampes et quand la lumière illumina la pièce, ils virent que quelqu'un y était venu, car rien n'était plus tel qu'ils l'avaient laissé.Le premier dit : « Qui s'est assis sur ma petite chaise ? »Le deuxième : « Qui a mangé dans ma petite assiette ? »Le troisième : « Qui a pris de mon pain ? »Le quatrième : « Qui a mangé de mes légumes ? »Le cinquième : « Qui s'est servi de ma fourchette ? »Le sixième : « Qui a coupé avec mon couteau ? »Le septième : « Qui a bu dans mon gobelet ? »Le premier, en se retournant, vit que son lit avait été dérangé. « Qui a touché à mon lit ? » dit-il. Les autres s'approchèrent en courant et chacun s'écria : « Dans le mien aussi quelqu'un s'est couché ! »Mais le septième, quand il regarda son lit, y vit Blanche-Neige endormie. Il appela les autres, qui vinrent bien vite et poussèrent des cris étonnés. Ils prirent leurs sept petites lampes et éclairèrent le visage de Blanche-Neige.« Seigneur Dieu ! Seigneur Dieu ! s'écrièrent-ils ; que cette enfant est jolie ! » Ils en eurent tant de joie qu'ils ne l'éveillèrent pas et la laissèrent dormir dans le petit lit. Le septième des nains coucha avec ses compagnons, une heure avec chacun, et la nuit passa ainsi. Au matin, Blanche-Neige s'éveilla. Quand elle vit les sept nains, elle s'effraya. Mais ils la regardaient avec amitié et posaient déjà des questions : « Comment t'appelles-tu ?— Je m'appelle Blanche-Neige, répondit-elle.— Comment es-tu venue jusqu'à nous ? »Elle leur raconta que sa belle-mère avait voulu la faire tuer, mais que le chasseur lui avait laissé la vie sauve et qu'elle avait ensuite couru tout le jour jusqu'à ce qu'elle trouvât cette petite maison. Les nains lui dirent : « Si tu veux t'occuper de notre ménage, faire à manger, faire les lits, laver, coudre et tricoter, si tu tiens tout en ordre et en propreté, tu pourras rester avec nous et tu ne manqueras de rien.— D'accord, d'accord de tout mon cœur, » dit Blanche-Neige. Et elle resta auprès d'eux. Elle s'occupa de la maison. Le matin, les nains partaient pour la montagne où ils arrachaient le fer et l'or ; le soir, ils s'en revenaient et il fallait que leur repas fût prêt. Toute la journée, la jeune fille restait seule ; les bons petits nains l'avaient mise en garde : « Méfie-toi de ta belle-mère ! Elle saura bientôt que tu es ici ; ne laisse entrer personne ! » La reine, cependant, après avoir mangé les poumons et le foie de Blanche-Neige, s'imaginait qu'elle était redevenue la plus belle de toutes. Elle se mit devant son miroir et demanda : « Miroir, miroir joli, qui est la plus belle au pays ? » Le miroir répondit : « Madame la reine, vous êtes la plus belle ici. Mais, par-delà les monts d'airain, auprès des gentils petits nains, Blanche-Neige est mille fois plus belle. »La reine en fut bouleversée ; elle savait que le miroir ne pouvait mentir. Elle comprit que le chasseur l'avait trompée et que Blanche-Neige était toujours en vie. Elle se creusa la tête pour trouver un nouveau moyen de la tuer car aussi longtemps qu'elle ne serait pas la plus belle au pays, elle savait que la jalousie ne lui laisserait aucun repos.Ayant finalement découvert un stratagème, elle se farda le visage et s'habilla comme une vieille marchande ambulante. Elle était méconnaissable. Ainsi déguisée, elle franchit les sept montagnes derrière lesquelles vivaient les sept nains. Elle frappa à la porte et dit : « J'ai du beau, du bon à vendre, à vendre ! » Blanche-Neige regarda par la fenêtre et dit : « Bonjour, chère Madame, qu'avez-vous à vendre ?— De la belle, de la bonne marchandise, répondit-elle, des corselets de toutes les couleurs. Elle lui en montra un tressé de soie multicolore. « Je peux bien laisser entrer cette honnête femme ! » se dit Blanche-Neige. Elle déverrouilla la porte et acheta le joli corselet.« Enfant ! dit la vieille. Comme tu t'y prends ! Viens, je vais te l'ajuster comme il faut ! » Blanche-Neige était sans méfiance. Elle se laissa passer le nouveau corselet. Mais la vieille serra rapidement et si fort que la jeune fille perdit le souffle et tomba comme morte. « Et maintenant, tu as fini d'être la plus belle », dit la vieille en s'enfuyant. Le soir, peu de temps après, les sept nains rentrèrent à la maison. Quel effroi fut le leur lorsqu'ils virent leur chère Blanche-Neige étendue sur le sol, immobile et sans vie ! Ils la soulevèrent et virent que son corselet la serrait trop. Ils en coupèrent vite le cordonnet. La jeune fille commença à respirer doucement et, peu à peu, elle revint à elle. Quand les nains apprirent ce qui s'était passé, ils dirent : « La vieille marchande n'était autre que cette mécréante de reine. Garde-toi de laisser entrer quelqu'un quand nous ne sommes pas là ! »La méchante femme, elle, dès son retour au château, s'était placée devant son miroir et avait demandé : « Miroir, miroir joli, qui est la plus belle au pays ? » Une nouvelle fois, le miroir avait répondu : « Madame la reine, vous êtes la plus belle ici. Mais, par-delà les monts d'airain, auprès des gentils petits nains, Blanche-Neige est mille fois plus belle. » Quand la reine entendit ces mots, elle en fut si bouleversée qu'elle sentit son cœur étouffer. Elle comprit que Blanche-Neige avait recouvré la vie.« Eh bien ! dit-elle, je vais trouver quelque moyen qui te fera disparaître à tout jamais ! » Par un tour de sorcellerie qu'elle connaissait, elle empoisonna un peigne. Elle se déguisa à nouveau et prit l'aspect d'une autre vieille femme. Elle franchit ainsi les sept montagnes en direction de la maison des sept nains, frappa à la porte et cria : « Bonne marchandise à vendre ! » Blanche-Neige regarda par la fenêtre et dit : « Passez votre chemin ! Je n'ai le droit d'ouvrir à quiconque.— Mais tu peux bien regarder, dit la vieille en lui montrant le peigne empoisonné. Je vais te peigner joliment. »La pauvre Blanche-Neige ne se douta de rien et laissa faire la vieille ; à peine le peigne eut-il touché ses cheveux que le poison agit et que la jeune fille tomba sans connaissance.« Et voilà ! dit la méchante femme, c'en est fait de toi, prodige de beauté ! » Et elle s'en alla.Par bonheur, le soir arriva vite et les sept nains rentrèrent à la maison. Quand ils virent Blanche-Neige étendue comme morte sur le sol, ils songèrent aussitôt à la marâtre, cherchèrent et trouvèrent le peigne empoisonné. Dès qu'ils l'eurent retiré de ses cheveux, Blanche-Neige revint à elle et elle leur raconta ce qui s'était passé. Ils lui demandèrent une fois de plus d'être sur ses gardes et de n'ouvrir à personne.Rentrée chez elle, la reine s'était placée devant son miroir et avait demandé : « Miroir, miroir joli, qui est la plus belle au pays ? » Comme la fois précédente, le miroir répondit : « Madame la reine, vous êtes la plus belle ici. Mais, par-delà les monts d'airain, auprès des gentils petits nains, Blanche-Neige est mille fois plus belle. »Quand la reine entendit cela, elle se mit à trembler de colère. « Il faut que Blanche-Neige meure ! s'écria-t-elle, dussé-je en périr moi-même ! » Elle se rendit dans une chambre sombre et isolée où personne n'allait jamais et y prépara une pomme empoisonnée. Extérieurement, elle semblait belle, blanche et rouge, si bien qu'elle faisait envie à quiconque la voyait ; mais il suffisait d'en manger un tout petit morceau pour mourir. Quand tout fut prêt, la reine se farda le visage et se déguisa en paysanne. Ainsi transformée, elle franchit les sept montagnes pour aller chez les sept nains. Elle frappa à la porte. Blanche-Neige se pencha à la fenêtre et dit : « Je n'ai le droit de laisser entrer quiconque ici ; les sept nains me l'ont interdit.— D'accord ! répondit la paysanne. J'arriverai bien à vendre mes pommes ailleurs ; mais je vais t'en offrir une.— Non, dit Blanche-Neige, je n'ai pas le droit d'accepter quoi que ce soit.— Aurais-tu peur d'être empoisonnée ? demanda la vieille. Regarde : je partage la pomme en deux ; tu mangeras la moitié qui est rouge, moi, celle qui est blanche. »La pomme avait été traitée avec tant d'art que seule la moitié rouge était empoisonnée. Blanche-Neige regarda le fruit avec envie et quand elle vit que la paysanne en mangeait, elle ne put résister plus longtemps. Elle tendit la main et prit la partie empoisonnée de la pomme. À peine y eut-elle mis les dents qu'elle tomba morte sur le sol.La reine la regarda de ses yeux méchants, ricana et dit : « Blanche comme neige, rose comme sang, noire comme ébène ! Cette fois-ci, les nains ne pourront plus te réveiller ! » Et quand elle fut de retour chez elle, elle demanda au miroir : Miroir, miroir joli, qui est la plus belle au pays ? Celui-ci répondit enfin : « Madame la reine, vous êtes la plus belle au pays. » Et son cœur jaloux trouva le repos, pour autant qu'un cœur jaloux puisse le trouver. Quand, au soir, les petits nains arrivèrent chez eux, ils trouvèrent Blanche-Neige étendue sur le sol, sans souffle. Ils la soulevèrent, cherchèrent s'il y avait quelque chose d'empoisonné, défirent son corselet, coiffèrent ses cheveux, la lavèrent avec de l'eau et du vin. Mais rien n'y fit : la chère enfant était morte et morte elle restait. Ils la placèrent sur une civière, s'assirent tous les sept autour d'elle et pleurèrent trois jours durant. Puis ils se préparèrent à l'enterrer. Mais elle était restée fraîche comme un être vivant et ses jolies joues étaient roses comme auparavant. Ils dirent : « Nous ne pouvons la mettre dans la terre noire. » Ils fabriquèrent un cercueil de verre transparent où on pouvait la voir de tous les côtés, l'y installèrent et écrivirent dessus son nom en lettres d'or, en ajoutant qu'elle était fille de roi. Ils portèrent le cercueil en haut de la montagne et l'un d'eux monta la garde auprès de lui. Longtemps Blanche-Neige resta ainsi dans son cercueil, toujours aussi jolie. Il arriva qu'un jour un prince qui chevauchait par la forêt s'arrêtât à la maison des nains pour y passer la nuit. Il vit le cercueil au sommet de la montagne, et la jolie Blanche-Neige. Il dit aux nains : « Laissez-moi le cercueil ; je vous en donnerai ce que vous voudrez. »Mais les nains répondirent : « Nous ne vous le donnerons pas pour tout l'or du monde. » Il dit : « Alors donnez-le-moi pour rien ; car je ne pourrai plus vivre sans voir Blanche-Neige ; je veux lui rendre honneur et respect comme à ma bien-aimée. »Quand ils entendirent ces mots, les bons petits nains furent saisis de compassion et lui donnèrent le cercueil. Le prince le fit emporter sur les épaules de ses serviteurs. Comme ils allaient ainsi, l'un d'eux buta sur une souche. La secousse fit glisser hors de la gorge de Blanche-Neige le morceau de pomme empoisonnée qu'elle avait mangé. Puis après, elle ouvrit les yeux, souleva le couvercle du cercueil et se leva. Elle était de nouveau vivante ! « Seigneur, où suis-je ? demanda-t-elle.— Auprès de moi, répondit le prince, plein d'allégresse. »Il lui raconta ce qui s'était passé, ajoutant : « Je t'aime plus que tout au monde ; viens avec moi, tu deviendras ma femme. » Blanche-Neige accepta. Elle l'accompagna et leurs noces furent célébrées avec magnificence et splendeur.La méchante reine avait également été invitée au mariage. Après avoir revêtu ses plus beaux atours, elle prit place devant le miroir et demanda : « Miroir, miroir joli, qui est la plus belle au pays ? » Le miroir répondit : « Madame la reine, vous êtes la plus belle ici. Mais la jeune souveraine est mille fois plus belle. » La méchante femme proféra un affreux juron et elle eut si peur, si peur qu'elle en perdit la tête. Le conte Blanche-Neige est très conu en Europe et en Amérique du Nord. Il a été écrit en 1812 par Jacob et Wilhelm Grimm.Les deux frères sont aussi les auteurs d'autres histoires et contes très célèbres tels que Cendrillon, La belle au bois dormant ou Le Petit Chaperon Rouge.Blanche-Neige et les sept nains de Walt Disney est sorti sur les écrans américains en 1937. C'est la première adaptation cinématographique du conte. C'est aussi le premier film d'animation au monde à la fois sonore et en couleurs. Les spectateurs de l'époque se sont déplacés en nombre pour voir les aventures de la jolie princesse aux prises avec sa méchante belle-mère. Aujourd'hui encore le film est très connu et très regardé. Quel objet la reine interrroge-t-elle sur sa beauté ?  Par quel fruit Blanche-Neige est-elle empoisonnée ?  Où vivent les sept nains ?  Où partent travailler les sept nains tous les jours ?  Comment Blanche-Neige se réveille-t-elle ?    Un jour de plein hiver, une reine était assise à sa fenêtre encadrée de bois d'ébène et cousait. Tout en tirant l'aiguille, elle regardait voler les blancs flocons. Elle se piqua au doigt et trois gouttes de sang tombèrent sur la neige. Ce rouge sur ce blanc faisait si bel effet qu'elle se dit : « Si seulement j'avais un enfant aussi blanc que la neige, aussi rose que le sang, aussi noir que le bois de ma fenêtre ! » Peu de temps après, une fille lui naquit ; elle était blanche comme neige, rose comme sang et ses cheveux étaient noirs comme de l'ébène. On l'appela Blanche-Neige.Mais la reine mourut en lui donnant le jour.  Au bout d'une année, le roi épousa une autre femme. Elle était très belle ; mais elle était fière et vaniteuse et ne pouvait souffrir que quelqu'un la surpassât en beauté. Elle possédait un miroir magique. Quand elle s'y regardait en disant : « Miroir, miroir joli, qui est la plus belle au pays ? » Le miroir répondait : « Madame la reine, vous êtes la plus belle au pays. » Et elle était contente. Elle savait que le miroir disait la vérité.Blanche-Neige, cependant, grandissait et devenait de plus en plus belle. Quand elle eut atteint ses dix-sept ans, elle était déjà plus jolie que le jour et plus belle que la reine elle-même. Un jour que celle-ci demandait au miroir : « Miroir, miroir joli, qui est la plus belle au pays ? » Celui-ci répondit : « Madame la reine, vous êtes la plus belle ici, mais Blanche-Neige est encore mille fois plus belle. » La reine en fut épouvantée. À partir de là, chaque fois qu'elle apercevait Blanche-Neige, son cœur se retournait dans sa poitrine tant elle éprouvait de haine à son égard. Elle en avait perdu le repos, le jour et la nuit. Elle fit venir un chasseur et lui dit : « Emmène l'enfant dans la forêt ! je ne veux plus la voir. Tue-la et rapporte-moi pour preuve de sa mort ses poumons et son foie. »Le chasseur obéit et conduisit Blanche-Neige dans le bois. Mais quand il eut dégainé son poignard pour en percer le cœur innocent de la jeune fille, celle-ci se mit à pleurer et dit : « Ô, cher chasseur, laisse-moi la vie ! Je m'enfoncerai au plus profond de la forêt et ne rentrerai jamais à la maison. »Le chasseur eut pitié d'elle et dit : « Sauve-toi, pauvre enfant ! » Mais il songeait : « Les bêtes de la forêt auront tôt fait de te dévorer ! » Un marcassin passait justement. Le chasseur le tua de son poignard, prit ses poumons et son foie et les apporta à la reine comme preuves de la mort de Blanche-Neige. Le cuisinier reçut ordre de les apprêter et la méchante femme les mangea, s'imaginant qu'ils avaient appartenu à Blanche-Neige. La pauvre petite, elle, était au milieu des bois, toute seule. Sa peur était si grande qu'elle regardait toutes les feuilles de la forêt sans savoir ce qu'elle allait devenir. Elle se mit à courir sur les cailloux pointus et à travers les épines. Les bêtes sauvages bondissaient autour d'elle, mais ne lui faisaient aucun mal. Elle courut jusqu'au soir, aussi longtemps que ses jambes purent la porter. Elle aperçut alors une petite maison et y pénétra pour s'y reposer. Dans la maisonnette, tout était minuscule, gracieux et propre. On y voyait une petite table couverte d'une nappe blanche, avec sept petites assiettes et sept petites cuillères, sept petites fourchettes et sept petits couteaux, et aussi sept petits gobelets. Contre le mur, il y avait sept petits lits alignés les uns à côté des autres et recouverts de draps tout blancs. Blanche-Neige avait si faim et si soif qu'elle prit dans chaque assiette un peu de légumes et de pain et but une goutte de vin dans chaque gobelet car elle ne voulait pas manger la portion tout entière de l'un des convives. Fatiguée, elle voulut ensuite se coucher. Mais aucun des lits ne lui convenait ; l'un était trop long, l'autre trop court. Elle les essaya tous. Le septième, enfin, fut à sa taille. Elle s'y allongea, se confia à Dieu et s'endormit. Quand la nuit fut complètement tombée, les propriétaires de la maisonnette arrivèrent. C'était sept nains qui, dans la montagne, travaillaient à la mine. Ils allumèrent leurs sept petites lampes et quand la lumière illumina la pièce, ils virent que quelqu'un y était venu, car rien n'était plus tel qu'ils l'avaient laissé.Le premier dit : « Qui s'est assis sur ma petite chaise ? »Le deuxième : « Qui a mangé dans ma petite assiette ? »Le troisième : « Qui a pris de mon pain ? »Le quatrième : « Qui a mangé de mes légumes ? »Le cinquième : « Qui s'est servi de ma fourchette ? »Le sixième : « Qui a coupé avec mon couteau ? »Le septième : « Qui a bu dans mon gobelet ? »Le premier, en se retournant, vit que son lit avait été dérangé. « Qui a touché à mon lit ? » dit-il. Les autres s'approchèrent en courant et chacun s'écria : « Dans le mien aussi quelqu'un s'est couché ! »Mais le septième, quand il regarda son lit, y vit Blanche-Neige endormie. Il appela les autres, qui vinrent bien vite et poussèrent des cris étonnés. Ils prirent leurs sept petites lampes et éclairèrent le visage de Blanche-Neige.« Seigneur Dieu ! Seigneur Dieu ! s'écrièrent-ils ; que cette enfant est jolie ! » Ils en eurent tant de joie qu'ils ne l'éveillèrent pas et la laissèrent dormir dans le petit lit. Le septième des nains coucha avec ses compagnons, une heure avec chacun, et la nuit passa ainsi. Au matin, Blanche-Neige s'éveilla. Quand elle vit les sept nains, elle s'effraya. Mais ils la regardaient avec amitié et posaient déjà des questions : « Comment t'appelles-tu ?— Je m'appelle Blanche-Neige, répondit-elle.— Comment es-tu venue jusqu'à nous ? »Elle leur raconta que sa belle-mère avait voulu la faire tuer, mais que le chasseur lui avait laissé la vie sauve et qu'elle avait ensuite couru tout le jour jusqu'à ce qu'elle trouvât cette petite maison. Les nains lui dirent : « Si tu veux t'occuper de notre ménage, faire à manger, faire les lits, laver, coudre et tricoter, si tu tiens tout en ordre et en propreté, tu pourras rester avec nous et tu ne manqueras de rien.— D'accord, d'accord de tout mon cœur, » dit Blanche-Neige. Et elle resta auprès d'eux. Elle s'occupa de la maison. Le matin, les nains partaient pour la montagne où ils arrachaient le fer et l'or ; le soir, ils s'en revenaient et il fallait que leur repas fût prêt. Toute la journée, la jeune fille restait seule ; les bons petits nains l'avaient mise en garde : « Méfie-toi de ta belle-mère ! Elle saura bientôt que tu es ici ; ne laisse entrer personne ! » La reine, cependant, après avoir mangé les poumons et le foie de Blanche-Neige, s'imaginait qu'elle était redevenue la plus belle de toutes. Elle se mit devant son miroir et demanda : « Miroir, miroir joli, qui est la plus belle au pays ? » Le miroir répondit : « Madame la reine, vous êtes la plus belle ici. Mais, par-delà les monts d'airain, auprès des gentils petits nains, Blanche-Neige est mille fois plus belle. »La reine en fut bouleversée ; elle savait que le miroir ne pouvait mentir. Elle comprit que le chasseur l'avait trompée et que Blanche-Neige était toujours en vie. Elle se creusa la tête pour trouver un nouveau moyen de la tuer car aussi longtemps qu'elle ne serait pas la plus belle au pays, elle savait que la jalousie ne lui laisserait aucun repos.Ayant finalement découvert un stratagème, elle se farda le visage et s'habilla comme une vieille marchande ambulante. Elle était méconnaissable. Ainsi déguisée, elle franchit les sept montagnes derrière lesquelles vivaient les sept nains. Elle frappa à la porte et dit : « J'ai du beau, du bon à vendre, à vendre ! » Blanche-Neige regarda par la fenêtre et dit : « Bonjour, chère Madame, qu'avez-vous à vendre ?— De la belle, de la bonne marchandise, répondit-elle, des corselets de toutes les couleurs. Elle lui en montra un tressé de soie multicolore. « Je peux bien laisser entrer cette honnête femme ! » se dit Blanche-Neige. Elle déverrouilla la porte et acheta le joli corselet.« Enfant ! dit la vieille. Comme tu t'y prends ! Viens, je vais te l'ajuster comme il faut ! » Blanche-Neige était sans méfiance. Elle se laissa passer le nouveau corselet. Mais la vieille serra rapidement et si fort que la jeune fille perdit le souffle et tomba comme morte. « Et maintenant, tu as fini d'être la plus belle », dit la vieille en s'enfuyant. Le soir, peu de temps après, les sept nains rentrèrent à la maison. Quel effroi fut le leur lorsqu'ils virent leur chère Blanche-Neige étendue sur le sol, immobile et sans vie ! Ils la soulevèrent et virent que son corselet la serrait trop. Ils en coupèrent vite le cordonnet. La jeune fille commença à respirer doucement et, peu à peu, elle revint à elle. Quand les nains apprirent ce qui s'était passé, ils dirent : « La vieille marchande n'était autre que cette mécréante de reine. Garde-toi de laisser entrer quelqu'un quand nous ne sommes pas là ! »La méchante femme, elle, dès son retour au château, s'était placée devant son miroir et avait demandé : « Miroir, miroir joli, qui est la plus belle au pays ? » Une nouvelle fois, le miroir avait répondu : « Madame la reine, vous êtes la plus belle ici. Mais, par-delà les monts d'airain, auprès des gentils petits nains, Blanche-Neige est mille fois plus belle. » Quand la reine entendit ces mots, elle en fut si bouleversée qu'elle sentit son cœur étouffer. Elle comprit que Blanche-Neige avait recouvré la vie.« Eh bien ! dit-elle, je vais trouver quelque moyen qui te fera disparaître à tout jamais ! » Par un tour de sorcellerie qu'elle connaissait, elle empoisonna un peigne. Elle se déguisa à nouveau et prit l'aspect d'une autre vieille femme. Elle franchit ainsi les sept montagnes en direction de la maison des sept nains, frappa à la porte et cria : « Bonne marchandise à vendre ! » Blanche-Neige regarda par la fenêtre et dit : « Passez votre chemin ! Je n'ai le droit d'ouvrir à quiconque.— Mais tu peux bien regarder, dit la vieille en lui montrant le peigne empoisonné. Je vais te peigner joliment. »La pauvre Blanche-Neige ne se douta de rien et laissa faire la vieille ; à peine le peigne eut-il touché ses cheveux que le poison agit et que la jeune fille tomba sans connaissance.« Et voilà ! dit la méchante femme, c'en est fait de toi, prodige de beauté ! » Et elle s'en alla.Par bonheur, le soir arriva vite et les sept nains rentrèrent à la maison. Quand ils virent Blanche-Neige étendue comme morte sur le sol, ils songèrent aussitôt à la marâtre, cherchèrent et trouvèrent le peigne empoisonné. Dès qu'ils l'eurent retiré de ses cheveux, Blanche-Neige revint à elle et elle leur raconta ce qui s'était passé. Ils lui demandèrent une fois de plus d'être sur ses gardes et de n'ouvrir à personne.Rentrée chez elle, la reine s'était placée devant son miroir et avait demandé : « Miroir, miroir joli, qui est la plus belle au pays ? » Comme la fois précédente, le miroir répondit : « Madame la reine, vous êtes la plus belle ici. Mais, par-delà les monts d'airain, auprès des gentils petits nains, Blanche-Neige est mille fois plus belle. »Quand la reine entendit cela, elle se mit à trembler de colère. « Il faut que Blanche-Neige meure ! s'écria-t-elle, dussé-je en périr moi-même ! » Elle se rendit dans une chambre sombre et isolée où personne n'allait jamais et y prépara une pomme empoisonnée. Extérieurement, elle semblait belle, blanche et rouge, si bien qu'elle faisait envie à quiconque la voyait ; mais il suffisait d'en manger un tout petit morceau pour mourir. Quand tout fut prêt, la reine se farda le visage et se déguisa en paysanne. Ainsi transformée, elle franchit les sept montagnes pour aller chez les sept nains. Elle frappa à la porte. Blanche-Neige se pencha à la fenêtre et dit : « Je n'ai le droit de laisser entrer quiconque ici ; les sept nains me l'ont interdit.— D'accord ! répondit la paysanne. J'arriverai bien à vendre mes pommes ailleurs ; mais je vais t'en offrir une.— Non, dit Blanche-Neige, je n'ai pas le droit d'accepter quoi que ce soit.— Aurais-tu peur d'être empoisonnée ? demanda la vieille. Regarde : je partage la pomme en deux ; tu mangeras la moitié qui est rouge, moi, celle qui est blanche. »La pomme avait été traitée avec tant d'art que seule la moitié rouge était empoisonnée. Blanche-Neige regarda le fruit avec envie et quand elle vit que la paysanne en mangeait, elle ne put résister plus longtemps. Elle tendit la main et prit la partie empoisonnée de la pomme. À peine y eut-elle mis les dents qu'elle tomba morte sur le sol.La reine la regarda de ses yeux méchants, ricana et dit : « Blanche comme neige, rose comme sang, noire comme ébène ! Cette fois-ci, les nains ne pourront plus te réveiller ! » Et quand elle fut de retour chez elle, elle demanda au miroir : Miroir, miroir joli, qui est la plus belle au pays ? Celui-ci répondit enfin : « Madame la reine, vous êtes la plus belle au pays. » Et son cœur jaloux trouva le repos, pour autant qu'un cœur jaloux puisse le trouver. Quand, au soir, les petits nains arrivèrent chez eux, ils trouvèrent Blanche-Neige étendue sur le sol, sans souffle. Ils la soulevèrent, cherchèrent s'il y avait quelque chose d'empoisonné, défirent son corselet, coiffèrent ses cheveux, la lavèrent avec de l'eau et du vin. Mais rien n'y fit : la chère enfant était morte et morte elle restait. Ils la placèrent sur une civière, s'assirent tous les sept autour d'elle et pleurèrent trois jours durant. Puis ils se préparèrent à l'enterrer. Mais elle était restée fraîche comme un être vivant et ses jolies joues étaient roses comme auparavant. Ils dirent : « Nous ne pouvons la mettre dans la terre noire. » Ils fabriquèrent un cercueil de verre transparent où on pouvait la voir de tous les côtés, l'y installèrent et écrivirent dessus son nom en lettres d'or, en ajoutant qu'elle était fille de roi. Ils portèrent le cercueil en haut de la montagne et l'un d'eux monta la garde auprès de lui. Longtemps Blanche-Neige resta ainsi dans son cercueil, toujours aussi jolie. Il arriva qu'un jour un prince qui chevauchait par la forêt s'arrêtât à la maison des nains pour y passer la nuit. Il vit le cercueil au sommet de la montagne, et la jolie Blanche-Neige. Il dit aux nains : « Laissez-moi le cercueil ; je vous en donnerai ce que vous voudrez. »Mais les nains répondirent : « Nous ne vous le donnerons pas pour tout l'or du monde. » Il dit : « Alors donnez-le-moi pour rien ; car je ne pourrai plus vivre sans voir Blanche-Neige ; je veux lui rendre honneur et respect comme à ma bien-aimée. »Quand ils entendirent ces mots, les bons petits nains furent saisis de compassion et lui donnèrent le cercueil. Le prince le fit emporter sur les épaules de ses serviteurs. Comme ils allaient ainsi, l'un d'eux buta sur une souche. La secousse fit glisser hors de la gorge de Blanche-Neige le morceau de pomme empoisonnée qu'elle avait mangé. Puis après, elle ouvrit les yeux, souleva le couvercle du cercueil et se leva. Elle était de nouveau vivante ! « Seigneur, où suis-je ? demanda-t-elle.— Auprès de moi, répondit le prince, plein d'allégresse. »Il lui raconta ce qui s'était passé, ajoutant : « Je t'aime plus que tout au monde ; viens avec moi, tu deviendras ma femme. » Blanche-Neige accepta. Elle l'accompagna et leurs noces furent célébrées avec magnificence et splendeur.La méchante reine avait également été invitée au mariage. Après avoir revêtu ses plus beaux atours, elle prit place devant le miroir et demanda : « Miroir, miroir joli, qui est la plus belle au pays ? » Le miroir répondit : « Madame la reine, vous êtes la plus belle ici. Mais la jeune souveraine est mille fois plus belle. » La méchante femme proféra un affreux juron et elle eut si peur, si peur qu'elle en perdit la tête.\n",

      "  Mon histoire se passe il y a très longtemps, dans un pays blanc balayé par la neige et le vent : le Toit du Monde.Le long de la banquise, un petit village d'iglous s'est construit pour l'hiver. Et tout au bout de ce village, dans le plus petit iglou, un chasseur vit seul, avec sa fille, Sanna. Éclairés par la lampe à huile, ils se partagent une nageoire de phoque. « Regarde-moi, Sanna. Je suis vieux et je reviens toujours bredouille de la chasse. Nous mangeons ce soir nos dernières provisions. Il faut que tu te maries. Il y a beaucoup de bons chasseurs qui rêveraient de t'épouser et qui pourraient t'apporter chaque jour un nouveau phoque à dépecer. Pourquoi ne veux-tu pas te marier ? » Mais, une fois de plus, sa fille ne lui répondit que par un silence gêné. Un jour, lassé de la voir refuser tous les hommes qui se présentaient, son père finit par lui dire : « Épouse donc notre chien et partez tous les deux loin du village, sur cette île que l'on aperçoit là-bas ! » La jeune femme, résignée, s'exila sur l'île avec son mari chien. Très vite, la nourriture vint à manquer. Le chien avait été un précieux atout pour son maître, mais maintenant qu'il était seul, il était incapable de rapporter du gibier. Les jours passèrent ainsi. Sanna tentait tant bien que mal de se nourrir de quelques poissons pêchés, mais cela ne contentait pas son estomac qui criait famine de plus en plus souvent. Les choses s'aggravèrent lorsqu'elle tomba enceinte puis accoucha d'une portée de petits chiens. Sanna ne parvenait plus à pêcher suffisamment de poissons pour nourrir toute la famille.Un matin, elle demanda à son mari d'aller chez son père chercher de la nourriture. Elle lui accrocha sa petite bourse en peau de phoque autour du cou et lui dit de nager jusqu'au village. Le chien arriva très affaibli sur le rivage, où il trouva le père de Sanna, occupé à dépecer un phoque : « Bonjour maître. C'est ta fille qui m'envoie. Elle a deux choses importantes à te dire. La première, c'est que tu es devenu grand-père. La seconde, c'est que ta fille et tes petits-enfants ont très faim. Je suis venu demander ton aide. » Le père emplit la bourse de viande de phoque et invita le chien à revenir chaque jour chercher de la nourriture.Ainsi, chaque matin, le mari chien quittait l'île pour le campement paternel et chaque soir, il revenait avec quelques victuailles : du phoque, du caribou, du poisson, et parfois même de la viande d'ours. Un jour, le père décida d'aller rendre visite à ses petits-enfants. Il ne les avait jamais vus et avait hâte de les rencontrer. Dès qu'il accosta sur l'île, les chiots accoururent à sa rencontre, pour fêter son arrivée. Ils l'accueillirent comme le font souvent les chiens avec leur maître : en lui mordillant les mollets et en lui donnant des grands coups de langue. Mais le père de Sanna n'apprécia pas du tout cet accueil. Il réalisa qu'il ne souhaitait pas avoir des chiots comme petits-enfants. Il aurait mille fois préféré être accueilli par des enfants qui lui auraient sauté au cou et qui l'auraient couvert de vrais baisers. Puis il trouva sa fille dans un état déplorable. Comme son mari chien ne pouvait pas chasser, elle mangeait rarement à sa faim et elle n'avait pas de peaux d'animaux pour se coudre des vêtements chauds. Le père de Sanna déposa la nourriture qu'il avait apportée et reprit la mer. Tout en ramant, il réfléchissait à une manière de mettre fin à cette situation intolérable. Le lendemain, lorsque le mari chien vint à nouveau chercher de la nourriture, le père remplit la petite bourse accrochée à son cou en y introduisant non pas de la viande mais de lourdes pierres. Le chien repartit à la nage, mais, alourdi par le poids de la bourse, il s'épuisa rapidement et se noya.Le père devait désormais approvisionner lui-même quotidiennement sa fille et ses petits-enfants. Mais Sanna craignait qu'il tue également ses bébés. Elle voulut le dissuader de revenir les voir et conseilla à ses enfants : « La prochaine fois que votre grand-père arrivera, allez à sa rencontre sur le rivage, léchez et mordillez son kayak puis donnez-lui des petits coups de dents de plus en plus féroces. » Son plan fonctionna à merveille : apeuré par l'accueil des chiots, le père de Sanna fit demi-tour et ne revint plus jamais sur l'île. Mais à peine ce danger écarté, un autre survint aussitôt : le spectre de la famine revint hanter la petite famille. En renonçant à leur principale source d'approvisionnement, Sanna et ses chiots étaient de nouveau confrontés à la faim. Alors, pour sauver ses enfants chiens, Sanna décida de les envoyer au loin. Elle les répartit en trois groupes et donna à chacun des consignes précises. Elle fit d'abord partir un premier groupe, muni d'arcs et de flèches, vers la forêt boréale, en lui disant : « Partez vers le sud et restez dans la forêt, vous y trouverez toujours de quoi vous nourrir ! » C'est ainsi que ces bébés chiens devinrent les ancêtres des Amérindiens.Sanna prit ensuite une semelle de ses bottes et prononça des paroles si puissantes que la semelle se transforma en umiaq, une très grande embarcation en peau de phoque. Elle y déposa les chiots du second groupe en leur disant : « Partez vers l'est, au-delà de cette grande mer, et ne revenez que sur de grands navires ! » Ils partirent sur les flots et devinrent les ancêtres des Européens.Quant aux chiots du troisième groupe, elle préféra finalement les garder près d'elle, sur le territoire des Inuits. Ils restèrent donc sur place et se transformèrent en ijiqqat, les esprits invisibles de l'intérieur des terres. Sanna, elle, retourna vivre dans le campement familial, sous l'iglou paternel. Elle resta veuve très longtemps, refusant à nouveau les hommes qui la demandaient en mariage, jusqu'au jour où un bel étranger vint au village pour la séduire…  L'histoire de Sanna est une légende inuit qui fait appel à des éléments surnaturels pour expliquer l'origine des peuples.Dans ce récit imaginaire, une semelle de chaussure devient, grâce à des mots magiques, une solide embarcation ! De même, une jeune fille peut se marier avec un chien et accoucher de petits chiots.  Chez les Inuits, le chien est un animal très important, car, pendant longtemps, il les a aidés à se déplacer et à chasser.De manière générale, les Inuits ont des liens étroits avec la Nature. C'est pourquoi leur mythologie unit les humains et les animaux. Il existe, par exemple, un chef des loups (Amaguq), un maître des ours polaires (Nanuq), ou encore un dieu de la chasse et des caribous (Tekkeitsertok). L'histoire se déroule dans un pays :  Dans le village, Sanna et son père vivent dans :  Sanna ne veut pas se marier.  Sanna se marie avec :  Les enfants de Sanna sont des bébés chiens.  Pour chasser le père de Sanna, les chiots mordent :    Mon histoire se passe il y a très longtemps, dans un pays blanc balayé par la neige et le vent : le Toit du Monde.Le long de la banquise, un petit village d'iglous s'est construit pour l'hiver. Et tout au bout de ce village, dans le plus petit iglou, un chasseur vit seul, avec sa fille, Sanna. Éclairés par la lampe à huile, ils se partagent une nageoire de phoque. « Regarde-moi, Sanna. Je suis vieux et je reviens toujours bredouille de la chasse. Nous mangeons ce soir nos dernières provisions. Il faut que tu te maries. Il y a beaucoup de bons chasseurs qui rêveraient de t'épouser et qui pourraient t'apporter chaque jour un nouveau phoque à dépecer. Pourquoi ne veux-tu pas te marier ? » Mais, une fois de plus, sa fille ne lui répondit que par un silence gêné. Un jour, lassé de la voir refuser tous les hommes qui se présentaient, son père finit par lui dire : « Épouse donc notre chien et partez tous les deux loin du village, sur cette île que l'on aperçoit là-bas ! » La jeune femme, résignée, s'exila sur l'île avec son mari chien.

      "  Rêve-d'un-Songe eut un jour l'envie de voyager. Et à ceux qui lui en demandèrent la raison, il répondit : « Je veux découvrir des choses qu'il ne m'est pas donné de voir chaque jour ». Rêve-d'un-Songe quitta donc les siens et partit. Il marchait depuis plus d'une lune, lorsqu'il vit un vieil homme qui pêchait au bord d'un fleuve. « Hey ! lui cria le vieux. Tu es Rêve-d'un-Songe, je te reconnais. J'ai bien connu ton père. Que puis-je faire pour toi ?—Me dire où mène ce chemin.—À ta place, je n'irais pas plus loin. Mais si tu veux continuer, je te conseille de prendre garde. Dans cette forêt, tu verras un nouveau-né suspendu à une branche. Surtout, ne fais pas attention à lui, car, en réalité, ce n'est pas un enfant mais l'odieux Serpent-qui-n'est-Jamais-Rassasié. » Avant de le laisser partir, le vieux lui donna un couteau. « Prends ça, tu pourrais en avoir besoin. »Rêve-d'un-Songe poursuivit sa route. Bientôt, il entendit des gémissements. Un bébé était suspendu à un arbre. Il passa devant sans s'arrêter, mais après quelques pas, il s'apitoya : « Qu'as-tu donc à pleurer ainsi ?—Cela fait plus de dix neiges que je n'ai pas tété ma mère. » Rêve-d'un-Songe lui donna son doigt à sucer. « Tiens, prends toujours cela, je n'ai rien d'autre à t'offrir. » Le nouveau-né s'arrêta de pleurer et entreprit de sucer le doigt. Puis il aspira la main. Et bientôt tout le bras disparut dans sa bouche. Effrayé, Rêve-d'un-Songe se souvint du couteau que lui avait donné le pêcheur. Il le planta dans le corps de l'enfant et celui-ci lâcha prise aussitôt. Mais quand Rêve-d'un-Songe regarda son bras, il vit que le Serpent-qui-n'est-Jamais-Rassasié avait avalé toute sa chair. « Heureusement, se dit-il, que je ne lui ai offert qu'un seul de mes bras. » Et il se remit en chemin. Et le garçon continua son voyage… jusqu'au moment où il vit un vieil homme qui mettait son canoë à l'eau. « Hey ! N'es-tu pas Rêve-d'un-Songe ? Ton père était mon ami et c'était un homme de bon sens. Que puis-je faire pour son fils ?—Je voudrais savoir où mène cette rivière.—Elle conduit au grand lac. Mais en réalité ce n'est pas un lac, il s'agit du Monstre-qui-Jamais-ne-Bouge. Il digère ceux qui entrent dans son vaste estomac. —Je veux y aller voir.—Alors, prends ce canoë. Cependant, fais très attention, dès que tu sentiras une odeur nauséabonde, tu devras revenir très vite. Sinon, tu pourrais le regretter car le monstre te dévorerait. »Rêve-d'un-Songe embarqua dans le canoë et descendit la rivière. Il arriva devant une large étendue d'eau et une odeur fétide le prit à la gorge. « Faut-il que je revienne maintenant ? » se demanda-t-il. Mais bien installé au fond de son canoë, il décida de continuer. Rêve-d'un-Songe ne se rendait pas compte qu'il était déjà avalé par le monstre. L'obscurité se fit autour de lui et elle devint de plus en plus épaisse à mesure qu'il progressait. Le jeune homme fut alors pris de peur. Il pagaya de plus en plus vite. Enfin, il vit devant lui une faible lueur qui grandit à mesure qu'il avançait. Puis ce fut une vive clarté. Rêve-d'un-Songe venait de sortir du monstre. Fou de joie, il agita le bras, et son embarcation chavira. Il nagea jusqu'à la rive et poussa un soupir de soulagement. Mais pendant cet affreux voyage, le monstre avait avalé toute sa chair. Le jeune homme revit alors le vieil homme qui lui avait donné son canoë. « Aide-moi. Porte-moi sur ton dos, je suis exténué. » L'homme répondit : « Ah tiens, voilà qui est bizarre, un squelette me parle.—Je ne suis pas un squelette, je suis Rêve-d'un-Songe. » Le vieillard fut secoué par un grand rire. « Ainsi, tu es ce jeune fou dont je connaissais le père. Tu n'as nul besoin d'aide puisque tu n'en fais toujours qu'à ta tête. » Et l'homme entreprit de couper un arbre sans plus s'occuper du jeune homme. Alors, Rêve-d'un-Songe retourna à pied dans son village. Ses amis rirent bien en le voyant. Une grue leur avait raconté toute l'histoire. Non seulement Rêve-d'un-Songe avait perdu son couteau, son tomahawk et son canoë dans l'aventure, mais le dernier mauvais génie l'avait sucé jusqu'à l'os. Et c'est ainsi qu'il vécut, à l'état de squelette, au milieu des siens.   Rêve-d'un-Songe eut un jour l'envie de voyager. Et à ceux qui lui en demandèrent la raison, il répondit : « Je veux découvrir des choses qu'il ne m'est pas donné de voir chaque jour ». Rêve-d'un-Songe quitta donc les siens et partit.

      "  Il était une fois un gentilhomme qui épousa en secondes noces une femme, la plus hautaine et la plus fière qu'on eût jamais vue. Elle avait deux filles de son humeur, et qui lui ressemblaient en toutes choses. Le mari avait de son côté une jeune fille, mais d'une douceur et d'une bonté sans exemple ; elle tenait cela de sa mère, qui était la meilleure personne du monde. Les noces ne furent pas plus tôt faites que la belle-mère fit éclater sa mauvaise humeur ; elle ne put souffrir les bonnes qualités de cette jeune enfant, qui rendaient ses filles encore plus haïssables. Elle la chargea des plus viles occupations de la maison : c'était elle qui nettoyait la vaisselle et les montées, qui frottait la chambre de madame, et celles de mesdemoiselles ses filles ; elle couchait tout au haut de la maison, dans un grenier, sur une méchante paillasse, pendant que ses sœurs étaient dans des chambres parquetées, où elles avaient des lits des plus à la mode, et des miroirs où elles se voyaient depuis les pieds jusqu'à la tête.La pauvre fille souffrait tout avec patience, et n'osait s'en plaindre à son père qui l'aurait grondée, parce que sa femme le gouvernait entièrement. Lorsqu'elle avait fait son ouvrage, elle s'allait mettre au coin de la cheminée et s'asseoir dans les cendres, ce qui faisait qu'on l'appelait communément dans le logis Cucendron. La cadette, qui n'était pas si malhonnête que son aînée, l'appelait Cendrillon ; cependant Cendrillon, avec ses méchants habits, ne laissait pas d'être cent fois plus belle que ses sœurs, quoique vêtues très magnifiquement.  Il arriva que le fils du roi donnât un bal, et qu'il priât toutes les personnes de qualité d'y venir : nos deux demoiselles en furent aussi priées, car elles faisaient grande figure dans le pays. Les voilà bien aises et bien occupées à choisir les habits et les coiffures qui leur siéraient le mieux ; nouvelle peine pour Cendrillon, car c'était elle qui repassait le linge de ses sœurs et qui godronnait leurs manchettes. On ne parlait que de la manière dont on s'habillerait.« Moi, dit l'aînée, je mettrai mon habit de velours rouge et ma garniture d'Angleterre.— Moi, dit la cadette, je n'aurai que ma jupe ordinaire ; mais en récompense, je mettrai mon manteau à fleurs d'or, et ma barrière de diamants, qui n'est pas des plus indifférentes. »On envoya quérir la bonne coiffeuse, pour dresser les cornettes à deux rangs, et on fit acheter des mouches de la bonne faiseuse : elles appelèrent Cendrillon pour lui demander son avis, car elle avait le goût bon. Cendrillon les conseilla le mieux du monde, et s'offrit même à les coiffer ; ce qu'elles voulurent bien. En se faisant coiffer, elles lui disaient : « Cendrillon, serais-tu bien aise d'aller au bal ?— Hélas, mesdemoiselles, vous vous moquez de moi, ce n'est pas là ce qu'il me faut.— Tu as raison, on rirait bien si on voyait un Cucendron aller au bal. »Une autre que Cendrillon les aurait coiffées de travers ; mais elle était bonne, et elle les coiffa parfaitement bien. Elles furent près de deux jours sans manger, tant elles étaient transportées de joie. On rompit plus de douze lacets à force de les serrer pour leur rendre la taille plus menue, et elles étaient toujours devant leur miroir. Enfin l'heureux jour arriva, elles partirent, et Cendrillon les suivit des yeux le plus longtemps qu'elle put ; lorsqu'elle ne les vit plus, elle se mit à pleurer. Sa marraine, qui la vit tout en pleurs, lui demanda ce qu'elle avait. « Je voudrais bien... je voudrais bien... » Elle pleurait si fort qu'elle ne put achever. Sa marraine, qui était fée, lui dit : « Tu voudrais bien aller au bal, n'est-ce pas ?— Hélas oui, dit Cendrillon en soupirant.— Hé bien, seras-tu bonne fille ? dit sa marraine, je t'y ferai aller. »Elle la mena dans sa chambre, et lui dit : « Va dans le jardin et apporte-moi une citrouille. » Cendrillon alla aussitôt cueillir la plus belle qu'elle pût trouver, et la porta à sa marraine, ne pouvant deviner comment cette citrouille la pourrait faire aller au bal. Sa marraine la creusa, et n'ayant laissé que l'écorce, la frappa de sa baguette, et la citrouille fut aussitôt changée en un beau carrosse tout doré. Ensuite, elle alla regarder dans la souricière, où elle trouva six souris toutes en vie ; elle dit à Cendrillon de lever un peu la trappe de la souricière, et à chaque souris qui sortait, elle donnait un coup de sa baguette, et la souris était aussitôt changée en un beau cheval ; ce qui fit un bel attelage de six chevaux, d'un beau gris de souris pommelé. Comme elle était en peine de quoi elle ferait un cocher : « Je vais voir, dit Cendrillon, s'il n'y a point quelque rat dans la ratière, nous en ferons un cocher.— Tu as raison, dit sa marraine, va voir. »Cendrillon lui apporta la ratière, où il y avait trois gros rats. La fée en prit un d'entre les trois, à cause de sa maîtresse barbe, et une fois touché, il fut changé en un gros cocher, qui avait une des plus belles moustaches qu'on ait jamais vues. Ensuite elle lui dit : « Va dans le jardin, tu y trouveras six lézards derrière l'arrosoir, apporte-les-moi. » Cendrillon ne les eut pas plus tôt apportés que la marraine les changea en six laquais, qui montèrent aussitôt derrière le carrosse avec leurs habits chamarrés, et qui s'y tinrent attachés, comme s'ils n'eussent fait autre chose toute leur vie. La fée dit alors à Cendrillon : « Hé bien, voilà de quoi aller au bal, n'es-tu pas bien aise ?— Oui, mais est-ce que j'irai comme cela avec mes vilains habits ? »Sa marraine ne fit que la toucher avec sa baguette, et en même temps ses habits furent changés en des habits de drap d'or et d'argent tout chamarrés de pierreries ; elle lui donna ensuite une paire de pantoufles de vair, les plus jolies du monde. Quand Cendrillon fut ainsi parée, elle monta en carrosse ; mais sa marraine lui recommanda avant toutes choses de ne pas passer minuit, l'avertissant que si elle demeurait au bal un moment davantage, son carrosse redeviendrait citrouille, ses chevaux des souris, ses laquais des lézards, et que ses vieux habits reprendraient leur première forme. Elle promit à sa marraine qu'elle ne manquerait pas de sortir du bal avant minuit. Elle partit, ne se sentant pas de joie. Le fils du roi, qu'on alla avertir qu'il venait d'arriver une grande princesse qu'on ne connaissait point, courut la recevoir ; il lui donna la main à la descente du carrosse, et la mena dans la salle où était la compagnie. Il se fit alors un grand silence, on cessa de danser et les violons ne jouèrent plus, tant on était attentif à contempler les grandes beautés de cette inconnue. On n'entendait qu'un bruit confus : « Ah, qu'elle est belle ! » Le roi même, tout vieux qu'il était, ne laissait pas de la regarder, et de dire tout bas à la reine qu'il y avait longtemps qu'il n'avait vu une si belle et si aimable personne.Toutes les dames étaient attentives à considérer sa coiffure et ses habits, pour en avoir dès le lendemain de semblables, pourvu qu'il se trouvât des étoffes assez belles, et des ouvriers assez habiles. Le fils du roi la mit à la place la plus honorable, et ensuite la prit pour la mener danser. Elle dansa avec tant de grâce qu'on l'admira encore davantage. On apporta une fort belle collation, dont le jeune prince ne mangea point, tant il était occupé à considérer la princesse. Elle alla s'asseoir auprès de ses sœurs, et leur fit mille honnêtetés : elle leur fit part des oranges et des citrons que le prince lui avait donnés, ce qui les étonna fort, car elles ne la connaissaient point. Alors qu'elles causaient ainsi, Cendrillon entendit sonner onze heures trois quarts : elle fit aussitôt une grande révérence à la compagnie, et s'en alla le plus vite qu'elle put. Dès qu'elle fut arrivée, elle alla trouver sa marraine, et après l'avoir remerciée, elle lui dit qu'elle souhaiterait bien aller encore le lendemain au bal, parce que le fils du roi l'en avait priée. Comme elle était occupée à raconter à sa marraine tout ce qui s'était passé au bal, les deux sœurs heurtèrent à la porte ; Cendrillon leur alla ouvrir. « Que vous êtes longtemps à revenir ! » leur dit-elle en bâillant, et se frottant les yeux, et en s'étendant comme si elle n'eût fait que de se réveiller ; elle n'avait cependant pas eu envie de dormir depuis qu'elles s'étaient quittées. « Si tu étais venue au bal, lui dit une de ses sœurs, tu ne t'y serais pas ennuyée : il y est venu la plus belle princesse, la plus belle qu'on puisse jamais voir ; elle nous a fait mille civilités, elle nous a donné des oranges et des citrons. »Cendrillon ne se sentait pas de joie : elle leur demanda le nom de cette princesse ; mais elles lui répondirent qu'on ne la connaissait pas, que le fils du roi en était fort en peine, et qu'il donnerait toutes choses au monde pour savoir qui elle était. Cendrillon sourit et leur dit : « Elle était donc bien belle ? Ne pourrais-je point la voir ? Mademoiselle Javotte, prêtez-moi votre habit jaune que vous mettez tous les jours.— Vraiment, dit mademoiselle Javotte, je suis de cet avis ! Prêter mon habit à un vilain Cucendron comme cela : il faudrait que je fusse bien folle. »Cendrillon s'attendait bien à ce refus, et elle en fut bien aise, car elle aurait été grandement embarrassée si sa sœur avait bien voulu lui prêter son habit. Le lendemain, les deux sœurs allèrent au bal, et Cendrillon aussi, mais encore plus parée que la première fois. Le fils du roi fut toujours auprès d'elle, et ne cessa de lui conter des douceurs ; la jeune demoiselle ne s'ennuyait point, et oublia ce que sa marraine lui avait recommandé ; de sorte qu'elle entendit sonner le premier coup de minuit lorsqu'elle ne croyait pas qu'il fût encore onze heures : elle se leva et s'enfuit aussi légèrement qu'aurait fait une biche. Le prince la suivit, mais il ne put l'attraper ; elle laissa tomber une de ses pantoufles de vair, que le prince ramassa bien soigneusement.Cendrillon arriva chez elle bien essoufflée, sans carrosse, sans laquais, et avec ses méchants habits, rien ne lui étant resté de toute sa magnificence qu'une de ses petites pantoufles, la pareille de celle qu'elle avait laissé tomber. On demanda aux gardes de la porte du palais s'ils n'avaient point vu sortir une princesse ; ils dirent qu'ils n'avaient vu sortir personne, qu'une jeune fille fort mal vêtue, et qui avait plus l'air d'une paysanne que d'une demoiselle. Quand ses deux sœurs revinrent du bal, Cendrillon leur demanda si elles s'étaient encore bien diverties, et si la belle dame y avait été ; elles lui dirent que oui, mais qu'elle s'était enfuie lorsque minuit avait sonné, et si promptement qu'elle avait laissé tomber une de ses petites pantoufles de vair, la plus jolie du monde ; que le fils du roi l'avait ramassée, et qu'il n'avait fait que la regarder pendant tout le reste du bal, et qu'assurément il était fort amoureux de la belle personne à qui appartenait la petite pantoufle. Elles dirent vrai, car peu de jours après, le fils du roi fit publier à son de trompe qu'il épouserait celle dont le pied serait bien juste à la pantoufle. On commença à l'essayer aux princesses, ensuite aux duchesses, et à toute la cour, mais inutilement. On l'apporta chez les deux sœurs, qui firent tout leur possible pour faire entrer leur pied dans la pantoufle, mais elles ne purent en venir à bout.Cendrillon qui les regardait, et qui reconnut sa pantoufle, dit en riant : « Que je voie si elle ne me serait pas bonne ! » Ses sœurs se mirent à rire et à se moquer d'elle. Le gentilhomme qui faisait l'essai de la pantoufle, ayant regardé attentivement Cendrillon, et la trouvant fort belle, dit que cela était juste, et qu'il avait ordre de l'essayer à toutes les filles. Il fit asseoir Cendrillon, et approchant la pantoufle de son petit pied, il vit qu'elle y entrait sans peine, et qu'elle y était juste comme de cire. L'étonnement des deux sœurs fut grand, mais plus grand encore quand Cendrillon tira de sa poche l'autre petite pantoufle qu'elle mit à son pied. Là-dessus arriva la marraine qui, ayant donné un coup de sa baguette sur les habits de Cendrillon, les fit devenir encore plus magnifiques que tous les autres. Alors ses deux sœurs la reconnurent pour la belle personne qu'elles avaient vue au bal. Elles se jetèrent à ses pieds pour lui demander pardon de tous les mauvais traitements qu'elles lui avaient fait souffrir. Cendrillon les releva, et leur dit, en les embrassant, qu'elle leur pardonnait de bon cœur, et qu'elle les priait de l'aimer bien toujours. On la mena chez le jeune prince, parée comme elle était : il la trouva encore plus belle que jamais, et peu de jours après, il l'épousa. Cendrillon, qui était aussi bonne que belle, fit loger ses deux sœurs au palais, et les maria le jour même à deux grands seigneurs de la cour. Munie de pouvoirs surnaturels, parfois aidée de sa baguette magique, la fée est capable du meilleur comme du pire. Elle peut voler, lancer des sorts ou modifier le futur. Ainsi, dans les contes de fée, l'histoire est ponctuée d'éléments surnaturels, magiques et merveilleux. De nombreuses expressions sont liées aux fées telles que « Avoir des doigts de fée » qui signifie être habile de ses mains ou « Être une fée du logis » qui veut dire être experte du ménage. Enfin, l'expression « Une fée s'est penchée sur son berceau » fait directement référence au conte La Belle au bois dormant et se dit de quelqu'un qui a de la chance. Quel est l'autre surnom de Cendrillon ?  Combien Cendrillon a-t-elle de sœurs ?  Dans quelle pièce de la maison Cendrillon dort-elle ?  Quelles sont les corvées que Cendrillon doit faire chaque jour ?  Avec quel légume la fée crée-t-elle un beau carrosse tout doré ?  Quels animaux ne font pas partie de ceux transformés pas la fée ?  Quel objet Cendrillon laisse-t-elle tomber en s'enfuyant du bal ?  Comment Cendrillon traite-elle ses sœurs une fois qu'elle épouse le prince ?    Il était une fois un gentilhomme qui épousa en secondes noces une femme, la plus hautaine et la plus fière qu'on eût jamais vue. Elle avait deux filles de son humeur, et qui lui ressemblaient en toutes choses. Le mari avait de son côté une jeune fille, mais d'une douceur et d'une bonté sans exemple ; elle tenait cela de sa mère, qui était la meilleure personne du monde. Les noces ne furent pas plus tôt faites que la belle-mère fit éclater sa mauvaise humeur ; elle ne put souffrir les bonnes qualités de cette jeune enfant, qui rendaient ses filles encore plus haïssables. Elle la chargea des plus viles occupations de la maison : c'était elle qui nettoyait la vaisselle et les montées, qui frottait la chambre de madame, et celles de mesdemoiselles ses filles ; elle couchait tout au haut de la maison, dans un grenier, sur une méchante paillasse, pendant que ses sœurs étaient dans des chambres parquetées, où elles avaient des lits des plus à la mode, et des miroirs où elles se voyaient depuis les pieds jusqu'à la tête.La pauvre fille souffrait tout avec patience, et n'osait s'en plaindre à son père qui l'aurait grondée, parce que sa femme le gouvernait entièrement. Lorsqu'elle avait fait son ouvrage, elle s'allait mettre au coin de la cheminée et s'asseoir dans les cendres, ce qui faisait qu'on l'appelait communément dans le logis Cucendron. La cadette, qui n'était pas si malhonnête que son aînée, l'appelait Cendrillon ; cependant Cendrillon, avec ses méchants habits, ne laissait pas d'être cent fois plus belle que ses sœurs, quoique vêtues très magnifiquement.  Il arriva que le fils du roi donnât un bal, et qu'il priât toutes les personnes de qualité d'y venir : nos deux demoiselles en furent aussi priées, car elles faisaient grande figure dans le pays. Les voilà bien aises et bien occupées à choisir les habits et les coiffures qui leur siéraient le mieux ; nouvelle peine pour Cendrillon, car c'était elle qui repassait le linge de ses sœurs et qui godronnait leurs manchettes. On ne parlait que de la manière dont on s'habillerait.« Moi, dit l'aînée, je mettrai mon habit de velours rouge et ma garniture d'Angleterre.— Moi, dit la cadette, je n'aurai que ma jupe ordinaire ; mais en récompense, je mettrai mon manteau à fleurs d'or, et ma barrière de diamants, qui n'est pas des plus indifférentes. »On envoya quérir la bonne coiffeuse, pour dresser les cornettes à deux rangs, et on fit acheter des mouches de la bonne faiseuse : elles appelèrent Cendrillon pour lui demander son avis, car elle avait le goût bon. Cendrillon les conseilla le mieux du monde, et s'offrit même à les coiffer ; ce qu'elles voulurent bien. En se faisant coiffer, elles lui disaient : « Cendrillon, serais-tu bien aise d'aller au bal ?— Hélas, mesdemoiselles, vous vous moquez de moi, ce n'est pas là ce qu'il me faut.— Tu as raison, on rirait bien si on voyait un Cucendron aller au bal. »Une autre que Cendrillon les aurait coiffées de travers ; mais elle était bonne, et elle les coiffa parfaitement bien. Elles furent près de deux jours sans manger, tant elles étaient transportées de joie. On rompit plus de douze lacets à force de les serrer pour leur rendre la taille plus menue, et elles étaient toujours devant leur miroir. Enfin l'heureux jour arriva, elles partirent, et Cendrillon les suivit des yeux le plus longtemps qu'elle put ; lorsqu'elle ne les vit plus, elle se mit à pleurer. Sa marraine, qui la vit tout en pleurs, lui demanda ce qu'elle avait. « Je voudrais bien... je voudrais bien... » Elle pleurait si fort qu'elle ne put achever. Sa marraine, qui était fée, lui dit : « Tu voudrais bien aller au bal, n'est-ce pas ?— Hélas oui, dit Cendrillon en soupirant.— Hé bien, seras-tu bonne fille ? dit sa marraine, je t'y ferai aller. »Elle la mena dans sa chambre, et lui dit : « Va dans le jardin et apporte-moi une citrouille. » Cendrillon alla aussitôt cueillir la plus belle qu'elle pût trouver, et la porta à sa marraine, ne pouvant deviner comment cette citrouille la pourrait faire aller au bal. Sa marraine la creusa, et n'ayant laissé que l'écorce, la frappa de sa baguette, et la citrouille fut aussitôt changée en un beau carrosse tout doré. Ensuite, elle alla regarder dans la souricière, où elle trouva six souris toutes en vie ; elle dit à Cendrillon de lever un peu la trappe de la souricière, et à chaque souris qui sortait, elle donnait un coup de sa baguette, et la souris était aussitôt changée en un beau cheval ; ce qui fit un bel attelage de six chevaux, d'un beau gris de souris pommelé. Comme elle était en peine de quoi elle ferait un cocher : « Je vais voir, dit Cendrillon, s'il n'y a point quelque rat dans la ratière, nous en ferons un cocher.— Tu as raison, dit sa marraine, va voir. »Cendrillon lui apporta la ratière, où il y avait trois gros rats. La fée en prit un d'entre les trois, à cause de sa maîtresse barbe, et une fois touché, il fut changé en un gros cocher, qui avait une des plus belles moustaches qu'on ait jamais vues. Ensuite elle lui dit : « Va dans le jardin, tu y trouveras six lézards derrière l'arrosoir, apporte-les-moi. » Cendrillon ne les eut pas plus tôt apportés que la marraine les changea en six laquais, qui montèrent aussitôt derrière le carrosse avec leurs habits chamarrés, et qui s'y tinrent attachés, comme s'ils n'eussent fait autre chose toute leur vie. La fée dit alors à Cendrillon : « Hé bien, voilà de quoi aller au bal, n'es-tu pas bien aise ?— Oui, mais est-ce que j'irai comme cela avec mes vilains habits ? »Sa marraine ne fit que la toucher avec sa baguette, et en même temps ses habits furent changés en des habits de drap d'or et d'argent tout chamarrés de pierreries ; elle lui donna ensuite une paire de pantoufles de vair, les plus jolies du monde. Quand Cendrillon fut ainsi parée, elle monta en carrosse ; mais sa marraine lui recommanda avant toutes choses de ne pas passer minuit, l'avertissant que si elle demeurait au bal un moment davantage, son carrosse redeviendrait citrouille, ses chevaux des souris, ses laquais des lézards, et que ses vieux habits reprendraient leur première forme. Elle promit à sa marraine qu'elle ne manquerait pas de sortir du bal avant minuit. Elle partit, ne se sentant pas de joie. Le fils du roi, qu'on alla avertir qu'il venait d'arriver une grande princesse qu'on ne connaissait point, courut la recevoir ; il lui donna la main à la descente du carrosse, et la mena dans la salle où était la compagnie. Il se fit alors un grand silence, on cessa de danser et les violons ne jouèrent plus, tant on était attentif à contempler les grandes beautés de cette inconnue. On n'entendait qu'un bruit confus : « Ah, qu'elle est belle ! » Le roi même, tout vieux qu'il était, ne laissait pas de la regarder, et de dire tout bas à la reine qu'il y avait longtemps qu'il n'avait vu une si belle et si aimable personne.Toutes les dames étaient attentives à considérer sa coiffure et ses habits, pour en avoir dès le lendemain de semblables, pourvu qu'il se trouvât des étoffes assez belles, et des ouvriers assez habiles. Le fils du roi la mit à la place la plus honorable, et ensuite la prit pour la mener danser. Elle dansa avec tant de grâce qu'on l'admira encore davantage. On apporta une fort belle collation, dont le jeune prince ne mangea point, tant il était occupé à considérer la princesse. Elle alla s'asseoir auprès de ses sœurs, et leur fit mille honnêtetés : elle leur fit part des oranges et des citrons que le prince lui avait donnés, ce qui les étonna fort, car elles ne la connaissaient point. Alors qu'elles causaient ainsi, Cendrillon entendit sonner onze heures trois quarts : elle fit aussitôt une grande révérence à la compagnie, et s'en alla le plus vite qu'elle put. Dès qu'elle fut arrivée, elle alla trouver sa marraine, et après l'avoir remerciée, elle lui dit qu'elle souhaiterait bien aller encore le lendemain au bal, parce que le fils du roi l'en avait priée. Comme elle était occupée à raconter à sa marraine tout ce qui s'était passé au bal, les deux sœurs heurtèrent à la porte ; Cendrillon leur alla ouvrir. « Que vous êtes longtemps à revenir ! » leur dit-elle en bâillant, et se frottant les yeux, et en s'étendant comme si elle n'eût fait que de se réveiller ; elle n'avait cependant pas eu envie de dormir depuis qu'elles s'étaient quittées. « Si tu étais venue au bal, lui dit une de ses sœurs, tu ne t'y serais pas ennuyée : il y est venu la plus belle princesse, la plus belle qu'on puisse jamais voir ; elle nous a fait mille civilités, elle nous a donné des oranges et des citrons. »Cendrillon ne se sentait pas de joie : elle leur demanda le nom de cette princesse ; mais elles lui répondirent qu'on ne la connaissait pas, que le fils du roi en était fort en peine, et qu'il donnerait toutes choses au monde pour savoir qui elle était.

Mademoiselle Javotte, prêtez-moi votre habit jaune que vous mettez tous les jours.— Vraiment, dit mademoiselle Javotte, je suis de cet avis !

      "  Le lièvre et le singe discutaient avec enthousiasme. Et, tout en conversant, chacun d'eux laissait libre cours à son tic familier. De temps à autre, le singe se grattait avec de brefs coups de patte tandis que le lièvre, qui redoutait sans cesse d'être surpris par quelque ennemi de son espèce, ne pouvait s'empêcher à tout instant de tourner la tête tantôt d'un côté, tantôt de l'autre. Les deux animaux ne pouvaient se tenir en repos. « Il est extraordinaire, vraiment, fit observer le lièvre au singe, que tu ne puisses laisser passer une minute sans te gratter !– Ce n'est pas plus étonnant que de te voir sans arrêt tourner la tête dans toutes les directions ! riposta le singe.– Oh, protesta le lièvre, je saurais bien m'en empêcher, si j'y tenais absolument !– Eh bien, voyons si tu pourras y parvenir. Tâchons, toi et moi, de rester immobiles. Celui qui bougera le premier aura perdu son pari.– Entendu ! » dit le lièvre.Et tous deux s'efforcèrent de ne plus faire le moindre mouvement.  L'immobilité ne tarda guère à leur sembler insupportable. Le singe avait des démangeaisons comme jamais auparavant. Quant au lièvre, il éprouvait de vives angoisses concernant sa sécurité, depuis qu'il ne pouvait plus lancer à tout instant des coups d'œil furtifs vers chacun des points de l'horizon.À la fin, n'y tenant plus : « Au fait ! dit-il, notre pari ne nous interdit pas de nous raconter quelque histoire pour rendre le temps moins long, n'est-il pas vrai, frère singe ?– Assurément ! » répondit celui-ci, qui se doutait de quelque stratagème de son compère, et comptait bien en faire son profit en s'inspirant de l'exemple qu'allait lui donner le lièvre.« Eh bien, je commence, dit ce dernier. Figure-toi qu'un jour de saison sèche, me trouvant dans une vaste plaine, je courus le plus grand des dangers…– Tiens, s'exclama le singe, il m'est arrivé la même chose !– Oui ! poursuivit le lièvre, je vis des chiens accourir vers moi en aboyant. Il en venait de tous côtés  à droite !… à gauche !… devant moi !… derrière moi !… Je me tournais de ce côté… j'en entendais par là et puis par là… et par là encore ! »Et tout en parlant, sire lièvre, comme entraîné par son récit, mimait ses inquiétudes en cette fâcheuse situation et regardait dans toutes les directions auxquelles il faisait allusion. Le singe, aussitôt l'histoire du lièvre terminée, commença son récit :« Un jour, dit-il, je fus assailli par une troupe d'enfants qui me pourchassèrent à coups de pierres. J'en recevais ici (il se grattait le flanc droit pour désigner la place où le coup avait porté), là !… (au flanc gauche), sur les reins, à la cuisse, à la nuque. » Et il indiquait chaque partie du corps qu'il nommait ainsi d'un geste précipité qui faisait cesser l'impérieuse démangeaison.Le lièvre ne pouvait plus contenir son envie de rire. Il éclata ! Et le singe, en le voyant pouffer, rit aussi de tout son cœur. « Vois-tu, nous aurons beau dire et beau faire, jamais nous ne changerons notre naturel. La preuve en est faite et bien faite. Tenons-nous-en là. Aucun de nous n'a gagné le pari, mais aucun ne l'a perdu. »  L'homme partage avec beaucoup d'espèces animales de nombreux points communs dont le langage corporel qui exprime notamment ce que nous ressentons. Ce langage se manifeste dans différents moments de la vie quotidienne par des gestes, des mimiques, des postures, des mouvements… Dans l'histoire, quel est le tic du lièvre ?  Dans l'histoire, quel est le tic du singe :  Pourquoi le lièvre et le singe se lancent-ils un défi ?  Que font le lièvre et le singe pour rendre le temps moins long ?

      "  Il y a fort longtemps vivaient en Chine deux frères. Wang, l'aîné, était le plus fort et brimait sans cesse son cadet. À la mort de leur père, les choses ne s'arrangèrent pas et la vie devint intenable pour Wang-cadet. Wang-l'aîné accapara tout l'héritage du père : la belle maison, le buffle et tout le bien. Wang-cadet n'eut rien du tout et la misère s'installa bientôt dans sa maison.Un jour, il ne lui resta même plus un seul grain de riz. Il fut donc obligé de se rendre chez son frère pour ne pas mourir de faim. Arrivé sur place, il le salua et lui parla en ces termes : « Frère aîné, prête-moi un peu de riz. » Mais son frère, qui était très avare, refusa tout net de l'aider et le cadet repartit bredouille.  Ne sachant que faire, Wang-cadet s'en alla pêcher au bord de la mer jaune. La chance n'était pas de son côté, car il ne parvint pas à attraper le plus petit poisson. Il rentrait chez lui les mains vides, la tête basse, le cœur lourd quand soudain, il aperçut une meule au milieu de la route. « Ça pourra toujours servir ! » pensa-t-il en ramassant la meule, et il la rapporta à la maison.Dès qu'elle l'aperçut, sa femme lui demanda : « As-tu fait bonne pêche ? Rapportes-tu beaucoup de poissons ?— Non, femme ! Il n'y a pas de poisson. Je t'ai apporté une meule.— Wang-cadet, tu sais bien que nous n'avons rien à moudre : il ne reste pas un seul grain à la maison. »Wang-cadet posa la meule par terre et, de dépit, lui donna un coup de pied. La meule se mit à tourner, à tourner et à moudre. Et il en sortait du sel, des quantités de sel. Elle tournait de plus en plus vite et il en sortait de plus en plus de sel.Wang-cadet et sa femme étaient tout contents de cette aubaine tandis que la meule tournait, tournait et le tas de sel grandissait, grandissait. Wang-cadet commençait à avoir peur et se demandait comment il pourrait bien arrêter la meule. Il pensait, réfléchissait, calculait, il ne trouvait aucun moyen. Soudain, il eut enfin l'idée de la retourner, et elle s'arrêta.À partir de ce jour, chaque fois qu'il manquait quelque chose dans la maison, Wang-cadet poussait la meule du pied et obtenait du sel qu'il échangeait avec ses voisins contre ce qui lui était nécessaire. Ils vécurent ainsi à l'abri du besoin, lui et sa femme. Mais le frère aîné apprit bien vite comment son cadet avait trouvé le bonheur et il fut assailli par l'envie. Il vint voir son frère et dit : « Frère-cadet, prête-moi donc ta meule. » Le frère cadet aurait préféré garder sa trouvaille pour lui, mais il avait un profond respect pour son frère aîné et il n'osa pas refuser.Wang-l'aîné était tellement pressé d'emporter la meule que Wang-cadet n'eut pas le temps de lui expliquer comment il fallait faire pour l'arrêter. Lorsqu'il voulut lui parler, ce dernier était déjà loin, emportant l'objet de sa convoitise.Très heureux, le frère aîné rapporta la meule chez lui et la poussa du pied. La meule se mit à tourner et à moudre du sel. Elle moulut sans relâche, de plus en plus vite. Le tas de sel grandissait, grandissait sans cesse. Il atteignit bien vite le toit de la maison. Les murs craquèrent. La maison allait s'écrouler.Wang-l'aîné prit peur. Il ne savait pas comment arrêter la meule. Il eut alors l'idée de la faire rouler hors de la maison, qui était sur une colline. La meule dévala la pente, roula jusque dans la mer et disparut dans les flots.Depuis ce temps-là, la meule continue à tourner au fond de la mer et à moudre du sel. Personne n'est allé la retourner.Et c'est pour cette raison que l'eau de la mer est salée. L'eau de mer contient du sel (environ 30 grammes pour 1 litre d'eau), elle n'est donc pas potable.Pour la rendre propre à la consommation, il faut mettre en place un processus de dessalement, c'est-à-dire diluer l'eau de mer avec de l'eau potable jusqu'à ce que l'indice de salinité diminue. Le savais-tu ?On récolte le sel dans les marais salants, bassins peu profonds d'où l'eau de mer s'évapore, ne laissant que le sel. As-tu déjà entendu parler de la mer Morte ? C'est un lac tellement salé que l'on y flotte beaucoup mieux que dans une eau de mer normale. Il contient 330 grammes de sel pour un litre d'eau !  L'eau douce est renouvelée grâce à la précipitation de vapeur d'eau atmosphérique sur la terre, qui circule dans les rivières et les fleuves jusqu'aux lacs et à la mer d'où elle s'évapore à nouveau. Une partie de l'eau de pluie s'infiltre dans le sol pour remplir les nappes phréatiques, réserves d'eau douce souterraines. C'est le cycle de l'eau.  L'eau douce est précieuse car elle est de plus en plus rare, notamment à certains endroits de la planète. Ce problème est accentué par le réchauffement climatique et les problèmes de pollution. Il faut donc apprendre à ne pas la gaspiller. Dans l'histoire, quel objet permet de moudre du sel ?  Quelle erreur commet Wang-cadet ?  Par quel procédé rend-on l'eau potable ?  Qu'est-ce qu'une nappe phréatique ?    Il y a fort longtemps vivaient en Chine deux frères. Wang, l'aîné, était le plus fort et brimait sans cesse son cadet. À la mort de leur père, les choses ne s'arrangèrent pas et la vie devint intenable pour Wang-cadet. Wang-l'aîné accapara tout l'héritage du père : la belle maison, le buffle et tout le bien. Wang-cadet n'eut rien du tout et la misère s'installa bientôt dans sa maison.Un jour, il ne lui resta même plus un seul grain de riz. Il fut donc obligé de se rendre chez son frère pour ne pas mourir de faim. Arrivé sur place, il le salua et lui parla en ces termes : « Frère aîné, prête-moi un peu de riz. » Mais son frère, qui était très avare, refusa tout net de l'aider et le cadet repartit bredouille.  Ne sachant que faire, Wang-cadet s'en alla pêcher au bord de la mer jaune. La chance n'était pas de son côté, car il ne parvint pas à attraper le plus petit poisson. Il rentrait chez lui les mains vides, la tête basse, le cœur lourd quand soudain, il aperçut une meule au milieu de la route. « Ça pourra toujours servir ! » pensa-t-il en ramassant la meule, et il la rapporta à la maison.Dès qu'elle l'aperçut, sa femme lui demanda : « As-tu fait bonne pêche ? Rapportes-tu beaucoup de poissons ?— Non, femme ! Il n'y a pas de poisson. Je t'ai apporté une meule.— Wang-cadet, tu sais bien que nous n'avons rien à moudre : il ne reste pas un seul grain à la maison. »Wang-cadet posa la meule par terre et, de dépit, lui donna un coup de pied. La meule se mit à tourner, à tourner et à moudre. Et il en sortait du sel, des quantités de sel. Elle tournait de plus en plus vite et il en sortait de plus en plus de sel.Wang-cadet et sa femme étaient tout contents de cette aubaine tandis que la meule tournait, tournait et le tas de sel grandissait, grandissait. Wang-cadet commençait à avoir peur et se demandait comment il pourrait bien arrêter la meule. Il pensait, réfléchissait, calculait, il ne trouvait aucun moyen. Soudain, il eut enfin l'idée de la retourner, et elle s'arrêta.À partir de ce jour, chaque fois qu'il manquait quelque chose dans la maison, Wang-cadet poussait la meule du pied et obtenait du sel qu'il échangeait avec ses voisins contre ce qui lui était nécessaire. Ils vécurent ainsi à l'abri du besoin, lui et sa femme. Mais le frère aîné apprit bien vite comment son cadet avait trouvé le bonheur et il fut assailli par l'envie. Il vint voir son frère et dit : « Frère-cadet, prête-moi donc ta meule. » Le frère cadet aurait préféré garder sa trouvaille pour lui, mais il avait un profond respect pour son frère aîné et il n'osa pas refuser.Wang-l'aîné était tellement pressé d'emporter la meule que Wang-cadet n'eut pas le temps de lui expliquer comment il fallait faire pour l'arrêter.

      "  On raconte que Zeus s'éprit un jour d'une jeune princesse phénicienne, fille du roi Agénor, et qui s'appelait Europe. Son admirable beauté éveilla le désir du dieu qui souhaitait à tout prix posséder la jeune femme. Tandis qu'elle se promenait dans les plaines comme à son habitude, accompagnée des jeunes demoiselles de Tyr et qu'elle s'amusait à composer des bouquets, Zeus fut émerveillé par le charmant tableau qu'offrait la jeune femme. Elle se penchait en riant pour couper la fine tige des fleurs et dégageait tant d'allégresse et de douceur qu'il fut aussitôt piqué par un ardent désir. Un troupeau de vaches passait tranquillement aux abords du champ où les jeunes femmes prenaient un peu de repos. Zeus ne pouvant se montrer aux yeux d'Europe sans risquer de la foudroyer tant sa puissance était colossale, et afin d'éviter la colère de son épouse jalouse, la terrible Héra, il prit la forme d'un majestueux taureau et se mêla au troupeau. Il ne souhaitait pas apeurer sa promise et trottait avec élégance, un regard doux et confiant posé sur la jeune créature. Son corps pourtant robuste ne dégageait rien de sauvage et sa splendeur était telle que la jeune princesse, d'abord intimidée, ne pouvait plus en détacher ses regards. Zeus, sous cette apparence, s'approcha de la belle Europe et s'étendit à ses pieds. Flattée, la jeune femme se mit à caresser les flancs du bel animal et, rassurée par sa douceur, para ses cornes de guirlandes fleuries. Le dieu déguisé était ébloui par tant de bienveillance et voulut témoigner de son affection en l'invitant à le chevaucher. Il pencha sa tête et plia les genoux, les sabots contre sa poitrine, comme une révérence. La jeune femme, croyant qu'il s'agissait là d'un jeu, monta sur le dos du jeune animal, plus confiante que jamais.  Innocente, elle prenait plaisir à laisser ses pieds nus le long du torse du taureau. Elle resplendissait, tandis qu'il s'éloignait lentement du lieu où les jeunes femmes se reposaient paisiblement.Puis, s'assurant que sa proie était solidement tenue, il partit au galop, piqué par la fougue, et atteignit le rivage d'un seul bond. Il se mit à fendre les flots avec tant d'ardeur qu'Europe, courbée sur son dos, encerclait son cou de peur d'être engloutie. Le vent faisait battre ses longs cheveux et les voiles de sa robe, et apeurée, elle se cramponnait à l'animal, sans oser émettre un seul cri. Elle ne put se retourner pour voir disparaître au loin ses amies et jamais ne revit son illustre père. Après un long et périlleux périple à travers l'océan, il étendit le corps fébrile de la jeune femme sur le rivage d'une terre inconnue. Épuisée, elle se laissa déposer sur le sable chaud. Ainsi Zeus ravit la belle Europe pour la mener sur l'île de Crète. Là, elle lui donna deux fils, Minos et Rhadamante, qu'elle éleva avec tendresse. Mais Zeus, dieu suprême, ne pouvait demeurer plus longtemps aux côtés de la douce Europe et décida d'en faire une reine en la donnant pour épouse au roi de Crète, Astérion. Dans la mythologie grecque, Zeus est le roi des dieux. Il est le souverain du ciel. Son arme la plus redoutable est la foudre qui lui a été offerte par les cyclopes. Zeus a ainsi le pouvoir de lancer des éclairs sur les hommes qui ont irrité les dieux. Il peut aussi décider des phénomènes célestes et des conditions atmosphériques. L'épouse officielle de Zeus est Héra. Déesse colérique, elle fait peur à Zeus. En effet, Héra supporte mal les infidélités continuelles de son époux. Zeus use donc de ruses pour éviter son courroux. Zeus est le père de nombreux dieux et héros. Il a pour fille Athéna la déesse de la guerre et de la sagesse et Artémis, déesse de la nature. Son fils Apollon est le dieu de la poésie. Zeus a aussi pu gagner le cœur de femmes mortelles comme Europe en prenant la forme de divers animaux. Les enfants issus de ces unions sont des demi-dieux et des héros. Lorsque Zeus aperçoit Europe, qu'est-elle en train de faire ?  Quel est le nom de l'épouse de Zeus ?  Sous quelle forme Zeus se transforme-t-il pour approcher Europe ?  Où Zeus emmène-t-il Europe ?  Comment les deux fils de Zeus et d'Europe se prénomment-ils ?    On raconte que Zeus s'éprit un jour d'une jeune princesse phénicienne, fille du roi Agénor, et qui s'appelait Europe. Son admirable beauté éveilla le désir du dieu qui souhaitait à tout prix posséder la jeune femme.

      "  Un bûcheron, sa femme et ses deux enfants vivaient à l'orée d'une forêt. Le garçon s'appelait Hansel et la fille Grethel. La famille était très pauvre. Une année, la famine régna dans le pays et le bûcheron, durant une de ses nuits sans sommeil où il ruminait des idées noires et remâchait ses soucis, dit à sa femme :« Qu'allons-nous devenir ? Comment nourrir nos pauvres enfants ? Nous n'avons plus rien à manger.— Eh bien, dit la femme, sais-tu ce que nous allons faire ? dès l'aube, nous conduirons les enfants au plus profond de la forêt, nous leur allumerons un feu et leur donnerons à chacun un petit morceau de pain. Puis nous irons à notre travail et les laisserons seuls. Ils ne retrouveront plus leur chemin, et nous en serons débarrassés.— Non, femme, dit le bûcheron, je ne ferai pas cela ! Comment pourrais-je me résoudre à laisser nos enfants tout seuls dans la forêt ! Les bêtes sauvages ne tarderaient pas à les dévorer.— Oh, fou ! rétorqua-t-elle, tu préfères donc que nous mourrions de faim tous les quatre ? » Elle n'eut de cesse qu'il acceptât ce qu'elle proposait. Les deux petits, n'ayant pas pu s'endormir à cause de la faim qui les tenaillait, entendirent les paroles de leur mère. Grethel pleura beaucoup et dit à son frère :« C'en est fait de nous !— Ne t'en fais pas, dit Hansel. Je trouverai un moyen de nous en tirer. » Quand les parents furent endormis, il se leva, enfila ses habits, et sortit de la maison. Hansel ramassa autant de cailloux qu'il put et les mit dans ses poches. Quand vint le jour, la femme réveilla les deux enfants : « Debout, paresseux ! Nous allons dans la forêt pour y chercher du bois. » Elle leur donna un morceau de pain à chacun et dit : « Voici pour le repas de midi ; ne mangez pas tout avant, car vous n'aurez rien d'autre. » Comme les poches de Hansel étaient pleines de cailloux, Grethel mit le pain dans son tablier. Puis, ils se mirent tous en route pour la forêt. Tout le long du chemin, Hansel, qui fermait la marche, jetait des cailloux blancs sur le chemin. Quand ils furent arrivés au milieu de la forêt, le père dit : « Maintenant, les enfants, ramassez du bois ! Je vais allumer un feu pour que vous n'ayez pas froid. » Hansel et Grethel amassèrent des brindilles au sommet d'une petite colline. Quand on y eut mis le feu et qu'il eut bien pris, la femme dit : « Couchez-vous auprès de lui, les enfants, et reposez-vous. Nous allons abattre du bois. Quand nous aurons fini, nous reviendrons vous chercher. » Les deux enfants s'endormirent. Quand ils se réveillèrent, il faisait nuit noire. Grethel se mit à pleurer et dit :« Comment ferons-nous pour sortir de la forêt ? » Hansel la consola. « Attends encore un peu, dit-il, jusqu'à ce que la lune soit levée. Alors, nous retrouverons notre chemin. »  Quand la pleine lune brilla dans le ciel, il prit sa sœur par la main et suivit les petits cailloux blancs. Alors que le jour se levait, ils atteignirent la maison. Ils frappèrent à la porte. La femme ouvrit et les vit. Elle dit : « Méchants enfants ! Pourquoi avez-vous dormi si longtemps dans la forêt ? Nous pensions que vous ne reviendriez jamais. » Leur père, lui, se réjouit, car il avait le cœur lourd de les avoir laissés seuls dans les bois.  Peu de temps après, la misère régna de plus belle et, une fois de plus, pendant la nuit, les enfants entendirent ce que la mère disait : « Il ne nous reste plus rien à manger, une demi-miche  seulement. Il faut nous débarrasser des enfants ; nous les conduirons encore plus profondément dans la forêt pour qu'ils ne puissent plus retrouver leur chemin ; il n'y a rien d'autre à faire. » Quand les parents furent endormis, Hansel se leva avec l'intention d'aller ramasser de nouveau des cailloux. Mais la femme avait verrouillé la porte et le garçon ne put sortir. Il consola cependant sa petite sœur :« Ne pleure pas, Grethel, dors tranquille ; le bon Dieu nous aidera. »  Tôt le matin, la mère fit lever les enfants. Elle leur donna un morceau de pain, plus petit encore que l'autre fois. Parvenus dans la forêt, les parents laissèrent les enfants pour aller couper du bois. Le soir, Hansel et Grethel firent du feu, puis ils dormirent, et la soirée passa sans que personne ne revînt auprès d'eux. Ils s'éveillèrent au milieu de la nuit, et Hansel consola sa petite sœur, disant : « Attends que la lune se lève, Grethel, nous retrouverons le chemin de la maison. »  Quand la lune se leva, ils se mirent en route. Mais les deux enfants marchèrent toute la nuit et le jour suivant, sans trouver à sortir de la forêt. Ils mouraient de faim, n'ayant à se mettre sous la dent que quelques baies. Ils étaient si fatigués que leurs jambes ne voulaient plus les porter. Ils se couchèrent au pied d'un arbre et s'endormirent.  Ils reprirent leur marche, s'enfonçant toujours plus avant dans la forêt. À midi, ils virent un joli oiseau sur une branche, blanc comme neige. Il chantait si bien que les enfants s'arrêtèrent pour l'écouter. Quand il eut fini, il déploya ses ailes et vola devant eux. Ils le suivirent jusqu'à une petite maison sur le toit de laquelle le bel oiseau blanc se percha. Quand ils s'en approchèrent, ils virent qu'elle était faite de pain et recouverte de gâteaux. Les fenêtres étaient en sucre. « Nous allons nous régaler, dit Hansel, et faire un repas béni de Dieu. Je vais manger un morceau du toit ; il a l'air d'être bon ! » Hansel grimpa sur le toit et en arracha une petite portion, pour goûter. Grethel se mit à lécher les carreaux. Tout à coup, la porte s'ouvrit et une femme, vieille comme les pierres, s'appuyant sur une canne, sortit de la maison. Hansel et Grethel eurent si peur qu'ils laissèrent tomber tout ce qu'ils tenaient dans leurs mains. La vieille secoua la tête et dit : « Hé, chers enfants ! qui vous a conduits ici ? Entrez, venez chez moi ! Il ne vous sera fait aucun mal. » Elle les prit tous deux par la main et les fit entrer dans la maisonnette. Elle leur servit un bon repas, du lait et des beignets avec du sucre, des pommes et des noix. Elle prépara ensuite deux petits lits. Hansel et Grethel s'y couchèrent. Ils se croyaient au paradis. Mais la gentillesse de la vieille femme n'était qu'apparente. En réalité, c'était une méchante sorcière qui n'avait construit la maison de pain que pour attirer les enfants. Quand elle en prenait un, elle le tuait, le faisait cuire et le mangeait. Pour elle, c'était alors jour de fête.  À l'aube, avant que les enfants ne se fussent éveillés, elle se leva. Elle attrapa Hansel, le conduisit dans une petite étable et l'y enferma. Il eut beau crier, cela ne lui servit à rien. La sorcière s'approcha ensuite de Grethel, la secoua pour la réveiller et lui dit : « Debout, paresseuse ! Va chercher de l'eau et prépare quelque chose de bon à manger pour ton frère. Il est enfermé à l'étable et il faut qu'il engraisse. Quand il sera à point, je le mangerai. »   Grethel se mit à pleurer, mais cela ne lui servit à rien. Elle fut obligée de faire ce que lui demandait la sorcière. Tous les matins, la vieille se glissait jusqu'à l'étable et disait : « Hansel, tends tes doigts que je voie si tu es déjà assez gras ».  Mais Hansel tendait un petit os et la sorcière, qui avait de mauvais yeux, ne s'en rendait pas compte. Elle croyait que c'était vraiment le doigt de Hansel et s'étonnait qu'il n'engraissât point. Quand quatre semaines furent passées, et que l'enfant était toujours aussi maigre, elle perdit patience et décida de ne pas attendre plus longtemps.« Holà, Grethel, cria-t-elle, dépêche-toi d'apporter de l'eau ! Que Hansel soit gras ou maigre, c'est demain que je le tuerai et le mangerai. » De bon matin, Grethel fut chargée de remplir la grande marmite d'eau et d'allumer le feu. « Nous allons d'abord faire la pâte, dit la sorcière. J'ai déjà fait chauffer le four et préparé ce qu'il faut. »Elle poussa la pauvre Grethel vers le four, d'où sortaient de grandes flammes. « Faufile-toi dedans ! ordonna-t-elle, et vois s'il est assez chaud pour la cuisson. »Elle avait l'intention de fermer le four quand la petite y serait, pour la faire rôtir. Elle voulait la manger, elle aussi. Mais Grethel devina son intention et dit : « Je ne sais comment faire. Comment entre-t-on dans ce four ?— Petite oie, dit la sorcière, l'ouverture est assez grande, vois, je pourrais y entrer moi-même. » Et elle y passa la tête. Alors Grethel la poussa vivement dans le four, claqua la porte et mit le verrou.  Pendant que la sorcière brûlait, elle courut vers la petite étable et dit : « Hansel, nous sommes libres ! La vieille sorcière est morte ! » N'ayant plus rien à craindre, ils pénétrèrent  dans la maison de la vieille femme. Dans tous les coins, il y avait des caisses pleines de perles et de diamants.« C'est encore mieux que mes petits cailloux ! » dit Hansel, en se remplissant les poches.Et Grethel fit de même. « Maintenant, il nous faut partir, dit Hansel, si nous voulons fuir cette forêt ensorcelée. » Au bout de plusieurs heures de marche, ils virent au loin leur maison. Ils se mirent à courir, se ruèrent dans la chambre de leurs parents et sautèrent au cou de leur père. Sa femme était morte entre-temps. Grethel secoua son tablier, et les perles et les diamants roulèrent à travers la chambre. Hansel en sortit d'autres de ses poches, par poignées. C'en était fini des soucis. Ils vécurent heureux tous ensemble.   Voici une excellente recette qui réjouira tous les gourmands !  250 g. de chocolat noir   125 g. de beurre   2 jaunes d'œuf   125 g. de sucre glace   50 g. de cacao   1 paquet de sucre vanillé   • Casse le chocolat en petits morceaux dans une casserole. • Demande à un adulte de faire fondre le chocolat au bain-marie, en ajoutant progressivement le beurre coupé en petits dés. Il faut mélanger le tout et, quand le beurre a bien fondu dans le chocolat, retirer le plat du feu. • Ajoute les jaunes d'œufs et le sucre glace. Mélange bien le tout. • Mets la pâte au réfrigérateur environ 2 heures pour qu'elle soit bien ferme. • Forme des petites boulettes de pâte à la main, roule-les dans le cacao et dispose-les dans un plat. C'est prêt !  Attention ! Cette activité nécessite l'aide d'un adulte. Comme la famille est très pauvre, les parents décident de :  Que met Hansel dans ses poches ?  Hansel et Grethel retrouvent le chemin de leur maison en suivant :  En suivant un joli oiseau, les enfants découvrent :  Quelle partie de la maison Hansel veut-il goûter ?  Pour faire croire qu'il est maigre, Hansel tend à la sorcière :  Comment se termine l'histoire ? Coche la ou les bonne(s) réponses(s).    Un bûcheron, sa femme et ses deux enfants vivaient à l'orée d'une forêt. Le garçon s'appelait Hansel et la fille Grethel. La famille était très pauvre. Une année, la famine régna dans le pays et le bûcheron, durant une de ses nuits sans sommeil où il ruminait des idées noires et remâchait ses soucis, dit à sa femme :« Qu'allons-nous devenir ?

Puis nous irons à notre travail et les laisserons seuls. Ils ne retrouveront plus leur chemin, et nous en serons débarrassés.— Non, femme, dit le bûcheron, je ne ferai pas cela !

Elle leur donna un morceau de pain, plus petit encore que l'autre fois. Parvenus dans la forêt, les parents laissèrent les enfants pour aller couper du bois. Le soir, Hansel et Grethel firent du feu, puis ils dormirent, et la soirée passa sans que personne ne revînt auprès d'eux. Ils s'éveillèrent au milieu de la nuit, et Hansel consola sa petite sœur, disant : « Attends que la lune se lève, Grethel, nous retrouverons le chemin de la maison. »  Quand la lune se leva, ils se mirent en route. Mais les deux enfants marchèrent toute la nuit et le jour suivant, sans trouver à sortir de la forêt. Ils mouraient de faim, n'ayant à se mettre sous la dent que quelques baies. Ils étaient si fatigués que leurs jambes ne voulaient plus les porter. Ils se couchèrent au pied d'un arbre et s'endormirent.  Ils reprirent leur marche, s'enfonçant toujours plus avant dans la forêt. À midi, ils virent un joli oiseau sur une branche, blanc comme neige. Il chantait si bien que les enfants s'arrêtèrent pour l'écouter. Quand il eut fini, il déploya ses ailes et vola devant eux. Ils le suivirent jusqu'à une petite maison sur le toit de laquelle le bel oiseau blanc se percha. Quand ils s'en approchèrent, ils virent qu'elle était faite de pain et recouverte de gâteaux. Les fenêtres étaient en sucre. « Nous allons nous régaler, dit Hansel, et faire un repas béni de Dieu. Je vais manger un morceau du toit ; il a l'air d'être bon ! » Hansel grimpa sur le toit et en arracha une petite portion, pour goûter. Grethel se mit à lécher les carreaux. Tout à coup, la porte s'ouvrit et une femme, vieille comme les pierres, s'appuyant sur une canne, sortit de la maison. Hansel et Grethel eurent si peur qu'ils laissèrent tomber tout ce qu'ils tenaient dans leurs mains. La vieille secoua la tête et dit : « Hé, chers enfants ! qui vous a conduits ici ? Entrez, venez chez moi ! Il ne vous sera fait aucun mal. » Elle les prit tous deux par la main et les fit entrer dans la maisonnette. Elle leur servit un bon repas, du lait et des beignets avec du sucre, des pommes et des noix. Elle prépara ensuite deux petits lits. Hansel et Grethel s'y couchèrent. Ils se croyaient au paradis. Mais la gentillesse de la vieille femme n'était qu'apparente. En réalité, c'était une méchante sorcière qui n'avait construit la maison de pain que pour attirer les enfants. Quand elle en prenait un, elle le tuait, le faisait cuire et le mangeait. Pour elle, c'était alors jour de fête.  À l'aube, avant que les enfants ne se fussent éveillés, elle se leva. Elle attrapa Hansel, le conduisit dans une petite étable et l'y enferma. Il eut beau crier, cela ne lui servit à rien. La sorcière s'approcha ensuite de Grethel, la secoua pour la réveiller et lui dit : « Debout, paresseuse ! Va chercher de l'eau et prépare quelque chose de bon à manger pour ton frère. Il est enfermé à l'étable et il faut qu'il engraisse. Quand il sera à point, je le mangerai. »   Grethel se mit à pleurer, mais cela ne lui servit à rien. Elle fut obligée de faire ce que lui demandait la sorcière. Tous les matins, la vieille se glissait jusqu'à l'étable et disait : « Hansel, tends tes doigts que je voie si tu es déjà assez gras ».  Mais Hansel tendait un petit os et la sorcière, qui avait de mauvais yeux, ne s'en rendait pas compte. Elle croyait que c'était vraiment le doigt de Hansel et s'étonnait qu'il n'engraissât point. Quand quatre semaines furent passées, et que l'enfant était toujours aussi maigre, elle perdit patience et décida de ne pas attendre plus longtemps.« Holà, Grethel, cria-t-elle, dépêche-toi d'apporter de l'eau ! Que Hansel soit gras ou maigre, c'est demain que je le tuerai et le mangerai. » De bon matin, Grethel fut chargée de remplir la grande marmite d'eau et d'allumer le feu. « Nous allons d'abord faire la pâte, dit la sorcière. J'ai déjà fait chauffer le four et préparé ce qu'il faut. »Elle poussa la pauvre Grethel vers le four, d'où sortaient de grandes flammes. « Faufile-toi dedans ! ordonna-t-elle, et vois s'il est assez chaud pour la cuisson. »Elle avait l'intention de fermer le four quand la petite y serait, pour la faire rôtir. Elle voulait la manger, elle aussi. Mais Grethel devina son intention et dit : « Je ne sais comment faire. Comment entre-t-on dans ce four ?— Petite oie, dit la sorcière, l'ouverture est assez grande, vois, je pourrais y entrer moi-même. » Et elle y passa la tête. Alors Grethel la poussa vivement dans le four, claqua la porte et mit le verrou.  Pendant que la sorcière brûlait, elle courut vers la petite étable et dit : « Hansel, nous sommes libres ! La vieille sorcière est morte ! » N'ayant plus rien à craindre, ils pénétrèrent  dans la maison de la vieille femme. Dans tous les coins, il y avait des caisses pleines de perles et de diamants.« C'est encore mieux que mes petits cailloux ! » dit Hansel, en se remplissant les poches.Et Grethel fit de même. « Maintenant, il nous faut partir, dit Hansel, si nous voulons fuir cette forêt ensorcelée. » Au bout de plusieurs heures de marche, ils virent au loin leur maison. Ils se mirent à courir, se ruèrent dans la chambre de leurs parents et sautèrent au cou de leur père. Sa femme était morte entre-temps. Grethel secoua son tablier, et les perles et les diamants roulèrent à travers la chambre. Hansel en sortit d'autres de ses poches, par poignées. C'en était fini des soucis. Ils vécurent heureux tous ensemble.  \n",

      "  Icare avait grandi parmi les inventions de son père Dédale, célèbre artisan de Crète. La plus fameuse de ses créations avait permis à la reine Pasiphaé de séduire un taureau, revêtant pour cela le faux costume d'une belle génisse. Mais cette curieuse union avait donné le jour à une bête monstrueuse, mi-homme, mi-taureau, que l'on nomma le Minotaure. Minos, roi de Crète, se sentit humilié par l'abominable fruit de la trahison de son épouse. Il en conçut une immense honte et voulut dissimuler l'horrible animal. Il fit appel à Dédale qui, après avoir aidé la reine, vola donc au secours du roi… Celui-ci lui demanda de construire un labyrinthe afin d'y enfermer le Minotaure. Convaincu du talent de son illustre architecte, son indignation fut quelque peu apaisée. Après des jours d'intense labeur, Dédale déposa enfin ses plans et fit débuter les travaux. Le labyrinthe était l'une de ses plus ingénieuses mais aussi la plus inquiétante de ses inventions. Il consistait en une interminable suite de détours et de lacets qui rendaient impossible à quiconque y pénétrait d'en trouver l'issue… Ainsi, le Minotaure y fut complètement pris au piège. Ses rugissements s'élevaient au-dessus des hautes murailles et son ombre terrifiante arpentait sans fin les méandres de son vaste enclos. Pour calmer ses accès déchirants de rage, Minos devait lui livrer de la chair humaine. Puisqu'il ne pouvait sacrifier ses citoyens, il ordonna aux Athéniens, qu'il avait vaincus lors d'une précédente expédition, de lui livrer sept jeunes hommes et autant de jeunes filles afin de les donner en pâture au Minotaure. Les jeunes gens qui avaient eu écho de cette effrayante bête, pénétrèrent apeurés dans le labyrinthe. C'est alors que Thésée, héros célébré et reconnu de tous, décida de mettre un terme au massacre et se rendit en Crète. Minos accueillit le jeune homme avec mépris et l'écouta distraitement, convaincu qu'il n'avait aucune chance de sortir vivant du labyrinthe. Mais Ariane, la ravissante fille du roi, apercevant le beau jeune homme en tomba amoureuse. Elle ne souhaitait pas voir son nouvel amant succomber sous les griffes du redoutable monstre et alla implorer Dédale afin qu'il lui vienne en aide. Celui-ci la convainquit de nouer au poignet de Thésée un long fil qui se déroulerait derrière ses pas, lui indiquant le chemin qu'il aurait à emprunter pour retrouver la sortie.  Grâce à ce stratagème, Thésée terrassa le Minotaure et un soupir de soulagement s'éleva du cœur de la cité athénienne. Quant à Minos, il se sentit une fois de plus trahi et s'empressa d'aller trouver Dédale qu'il enferma avec son fils dans son propre labyrinthe ! Dédale était au désespoir : sans fil attaché à son poignet, il ne savait que trop bien ce à quoi il était condamné tant son œuvre était infaillible. Il regrettait amèrement d'avoir inventé ce terrible piège ! Il leva les yeux au ciel dans l'espoir d'y voir poindre la clémence des dieux et s'apprêta à les implorer quand lui vint une brillante idée : il n'y avait aucune chance de trouver l'issue terrestre du tortueux labyrinthe, certes, mais la voie des airs, elle, s'offrait à eux dans toute son étendue ! Il avait avec lui de la cire et n'eut pas de mal à se procurer des plumes… Il se mit donc à confectionner pour lui et son fils de majestueuses ailes assez résistantes pour les soulever de terre. Après les avoir fixées sur le dos d'Icare, il prit son visage entre ses mains et lui dit : « Mon fils, écoute les sages conseils de ton père afin de mener au mieux notre évasion. Lorsque tu seras transporté par les airs, surtout ne t'avise pas de prendre trop d'altitude, la chaleur du Soleil risquerait de te brûler les ailes. De même, ne t'approche pas trop de l'océan et de ses hautes vagues qui pourraient t'ensevelir. »  Exalté, Icare piaffait d'impatience, car comme la plupart d'entre nous, il avait maintes fois rêvé de fendre les airs comme un oiseau. Ils s'élancèrent hors du labyrinthe et atteignirent le ciel grâce à leurs ailes amples et légères. Porté par le vent, Icare se laissait enivrer par le plaisir de sentir la brise le bercer. Le père et le fils volèrent ainsi un long moment, surplombant les sublimes paysages de la Grèce, mais lorsqu'ils atteignirent le détroit qui les séparait de l'Asie Mineure, Icare ne put résister à son désir et désobéit aux sages paroles de son père. Grisé par le goût de la liberté, il s'élança vers les hauteurs. Il s'approcha dangereusement du Soleil et n'entendait pas les cris désespérés de son pauvre père qui percevait trop bien où risquait de le mener son imprudence. Icare jouissait de sa puissance aérienne et, prenant de plus en plus d'altitude, se pensait l'égal des oiseaux. Mais, ne résistant pas à l'intense chaleur de l'astre, la cire de ses ailes se mit à fondre, et le jeune garçon fut précipité dans le vide avant de plonger dans la mer qui porte aujourd'hui son nom. Dédale, fou de douleur, alla repêcher le corps sans vie de son fils. Le jeune homme, par défaut d'expérience et de sagesse, avait brûlé l'innocence de son jeune âge à l'attirante chaleur de l'astre solaire.  Thésée admirait Hercule et, comme lui, il rêvait d'accomplir de grands exploits. À seize ans seulement, il déplaça un énorme rocher sous lequel ses armes avaient été dissimulées. Puis il tua une bande de brigands, avant de rejoindre le Crète. Là, il dut se battre contre le Minotaure un monstre mi-homme, mi-taureau. Plus tard, il affronta aussi les Centaures et les Amazones. Et il fut finalement jeté aux Enfers. Il patienta longtemps dans le Royaume des morts, jusqu'à ce qu'Hercule vienne le délivrer. Notre héros périt bien des années plus tard : le roi jaloux le poussa du haut d'un rocher.  Comment s'appelle le père d'Icare ?  Quel est le métier de Dédale ?  Le Minotaure ressemble à :  Pourquoi Thésée va-t-il dans le labyrinthe ?  Thésée parvient à sortir du labyrinthe grâce :  Le roi Minos enferme Dédale et Icare dans le labyrinthe, car :  Pour s'échapper du labyrinthe, Dédale a l'idée de :  Avant de s'envoler, Dédale met en garde son fils contre :    Icare avait grandi parmi les inventions de son père Dédale, célèbre artisan de Crète.

      "  Il était une fois un roi et une reine. Chaque jour ils se lamentaient : « Ah ! si seulement nous avions un enfant. » Mais d'enfant, point. Un jour que la reine était au bain, une grenouille bondit hors de l'eau et lui dit : « Ton vœu sera exaucé. Avant qu'une année soit passée, tu mettras au monde une fillette. » Ce que la grenouille avait prédit arriva. La reine donna le jour à une fille. Elle était si belle que le roi ne se tenait plus de joie. Il organisa une grande fête. Il ne se contenta pas d'y inviter ses parents, ses amis et connaissances, mais il invita aussi des fées afin qu'elles fussent favorables à l'enfant. Il y en avait treize dans son royaume. Mais, comme il ne possédait que douze assiettes d'or pour leur servir un repas, l'une d'elles ne fut pas invitée.La fête fut magnifique. Alors qu'elle touchait à sa fin, les fées offrirent à l'enfant de fabuleux cadeaux : l'une la vertu, l'autre la beauté, la troisième la richesse et ainsi de suite, tout ce qui est désirable au monde. Comme onze des fées venaient d'agir ainsi, la treizième survint tout à coup. Elle voulait se venger de n'avoir pas été invitée. Sans saluer quiconque, elle s'écria d'une forte voix : « La fille du roi, dans sa quinzième année, se piquera à un fuseau et tombera raide morte. » Puis elle quitta la salle. Tout le monde fut fort effrayé. La douzième des fées, celle qui n'avait pas encore formé son vœu, s'avança alors. Et comme elle ne pouvait pas annuler le mauvais sort, mais seulement le rendre moins dangereux, elle dit : « Ce ne sera pas une mort véritable, seulement un sommeil de cent années dans lequel sera plongée la fille du roi. » Le roi, qui aurait bien voulu préserver son enfant adorée du malheur, ordonna que tous les fuseaux fussent brûlés dans le royaume. Cependant, tous les dons que lui avaient donnés les fées s'épanouissaient chez la jeune fille. Elle était si belle, si vertueuse, si gentille et si raisonnable que tous ceux qui la voyaient l'aimaient. Il advint que le jour de sa quinzième année, le roi et la reine quittèrent leur demeure. La jeune fille resta seule au château. Elle s'y promena partout, visitant les salles et les chambres à sa fantaisie. Finalement, elle entra dans une vieille tour. Elle escalada l'étroit escalier en colimaçon et parvint à une petite porte. Dans la serrure, il y avait une clé rouillée. Elle la tourna. La porte s'ouvrit brusquement. Une vieille femme filant son lin avec application était assise dans une petite chambre.« Bonjour, grand-mère, dit la jeune fille. Que fais-tu là ?— Je file, dit la vieille en branlant la tête.— Qu'est-ce donc que cette chose que tu fais bondir si joyeusement ? » demanda la jeune fille.Elle s'empara du fuseau et voulut filer à son tour. À peine l'eut-elle touché que le mauvais sort s'accomplit : elle se piqua au doigt. À l'instant même, elle s'affaissa sur un lit qui se trouvait là et tomba dans un profond sommeil. Et ce sommeil se répandit sur l'ensemble du château. Le roi et la reine, qui venaient tout juste de revenir et pénétraient dans la grande salle du palais, s'endormirent. Et avec eux, toute la cour. Les chevaux s'endormirent dans leurs écuries, les chiens dans la cour, les pigeons sur le toit, les mouches contre les murs. Même le feu qui brûlait dans l'âtre s'endormit et le rôti s'arrêta de rôtir. Le cuisinier, qui était en train de tirer les cheveux du marmiton parce qu'il avait raté un plat, le lâcha et s'endormit. Et le vent cessa de souffler. Nulle feuille ne bougea plus sur les arbres devant le château. Tout autour du palais, une haie d'épines se mit à pousser, qui chaque jour devint plus haute et plus touffue. Bientôt, elle cerna complètement le château, jusqu'à ce qu'on n'en vît plus rien, même pas le drapeau sur le toit.  Dans le pays, la légende de la Belle au bois dormant — c'est ainsi que fut nommée la fille du roi — se répandait. De temps en temps, des fils de roi s'approchaient du château et tentaient d'y pénétrer à travers l'épaisse muraille d'épines. Mais ils n'y parvenaient pas. Les épines se tenaient entre elles, comme par des mains. Les jeunes princes y restaient accrochés, sans pouvoir se détacher et mouraient là, d'une mort cruelle.Au bout de longues, longues années, le fils d'un roi passa par le pays. Un vieillard lui raconta l'histoire de la haie d'épines. Derrière elle, il devait y avoir un château dans lequel dormait, depuis cent ans, la merveilleuse fille d'un roi, appelée la Belle au bois dormant. Avec elle dormaient le roi, la reine et toute la cour. Le vieil homme avait aussi appris de son grand-père que de nombreux princes étaient déjà venus et avaient tenté de forcer la haie d'épines ; mais ils y étaient restés accrochés et y étaient morts d'une triste mort. Le jeune homme dit alors : « Je n'ai peur de rien, je vais y aller. Je veux voir la Belle au bois dormant. »Le bon vieillard voulut l'en empêcher, mais il eut beau faire, le prince ne l'écouta pas. Or, les cent années étaient justement écoulées et le jour était venu où la Belle au bois dormant devait se réveiller. Lorsque le fils du roi s'approcha de la haie d'épines, il vit de magnifiques fleurs qui s'écartaient d'elles-mêmes sur son passage et lui laissaient le chemin. Derrière lui, elles reformaient une haie. Dans le château, il vit les chevaux et les chiens de chasse tachetés qui dormaient. Sur le toit, les pigeons se tenaient la tête sous l'aile. Et lorsqu'il pénétra dans le palais, il vit les mouches qui dormaient contre les murs. Le cuisinier, dans la cuisine, avait encore la main levée comme s'il voulait attraper le marmiton et la bonne était assise devant une poule noire qu'elle allait plumer. En haut, sur les marches du trône, le roi et la reine étaient endormis. Le prince poursuivit son chemin et le silence était si profond qu'il entendait son propre souffle. Enfin, il arriva à la tour et poussa la porte de la petite chambre où dormait la Belle.Elle était là, si jolie qu'il ne put en détourner le regard. Il se pencha sur elle et lui donna un baiser. Alors, la Belle au bois dormant s'éveilla, ouvrit les yeux et le regarda en souriant. Ils sortirent tous deux et le roi s'éveilla à son tour, et la reine, et toute la cour. Et tout le monde se regardait avec de grands yeux.Dans les écuries, les chevaux se dressaient sur leurs pattes et s'ébrouaient ; les chiens de chasse bondirent en remuant la queue. Sur le toit, les pigeons sortirent la tête de sous leur aile, regardèrent autour d'eux et s'envolèrent vers la campagne. Les mouches, sur les murs, reprirent leur mouvement ; dans la cuisine, le feu s'alluma, flamba et cuisit le repas. Le rôti se remit à rissoler ; le cuisinier donna une gifle au marmiton, si fort que celui-ci en cria, et la bonne acheva de plumer la poule.Le mariage du prince et de la Belle au bois dormant fut célébré avec un faste exceptionnel. Et ils vécurent heureux jusqu'à leur mort. On les imagine souvent avec une forme féminine, comme c'est le cas dans de nombreux contes, pourtant, selon les cultures, les êtres féeriques prennent de nombreuses formes. En Scandinavie, les membres du Peuple des fées sont les elfes, jeunes et beaux, les gnomes, petits êtres vivant sous terre, et les trolls, puissants géants des montagnes. Au Japon, le kitsune, esprit rusé comme le renard, imprègne la culture populaire et les mangas. En Allemagne, le célèbre gobelin est un être féerique à la peau verte et à la fine moustache. Tu connais peut-être les célèbres fées Mélusine, Morgane, Viviane, ou encore Carabosse ? Pourquoi la treizième fée du conte jette-t-elle un mauvais sort à la petite fille le jour de son baptême ?  Comment la Belle au bois dormant s'endort-elle ?  Comment la Belle au bois dormant est-elle réveillée ?    Il était une fois un roi et une reine. Chaque jour ils se lamentaient : « Ah ! si seulement nous avions un enfant. » Mais d'enfant, point. Un jour que la reine était au bain, une grenouille bondit hors de l'eau et lui dit : « Ton vœu sera exaucé. Avant qu'une année soit passée, tu mettras au monde une fillette. » Ce que la grenouille avait prédit arriva. La reine donna le jour à une fille. Elle était si belle que le roi ne se tenait plus de joie. Il organisa une grande fête. Il ne se contenta pas d'y inviter ses parents, ses amis et connaissances, mais il invita aussi des fées afin qu'elles fussent favorables à l'enfant. Il y en avait treize dans son royaume. Mais, comme il ne possédait que douze assiettes d'or pour leur servir un repas, l'une d'elles ne fut pas invitée.La fête fut magnifique. Alors qu'elle touchait à sa fin, les fées offrirent à l'enfant de fabuleux cadeaux : l'une la vertu, l'autre la beauté, la troisième la richesse et ainsi de suite, tout ce qui est désirable au monde. Comme onze des fées venaient d'agir ainsi, la treizième survint tout à coup. Elle voulait se venger de n'avoir pas été invitée. Sans saluer quiconque, elle s'écria d'une forte voix : « La fille du roi, dans sa quinzième année, se piquera à un fuseau et tombera raide morte. » Puis elle quitta la salle. Tout le monde fut fort effrayé. La douzième des fées, celle qui n'avait pas encore formé son vœu, s'avança alors. Et comme elle ne pouvait pas annuler le mauvais sort, mais seulement le rendre moins dangereux, elle dit : « Ce ne sera pas une mort véritable, seulement un sommeil de cent années dans lequel sera plongée la fille du roi. » Le roi, qui aurait bien voulu préserver son enfant adorée du malheur, ordonna que tous les fuseaux fussent brûlés dans le royaume. Cependant, tous les dons que lui avaient donnés les fées s'épanouissaient chez la jeune fille. Elle était si belle, si vertueuse, si gentille et si raisonnable que tous ceux qui la voyaient l'aimaient. Il advint que le jour de sa quinzième année, le roi et la reine quittèrent leur demeure. La jeune fille resta seule au château. Elle s'y promena partout, visitant les salles et les chambres à sa fantaisie. Finalement, elle entra dans une vieille tour. Elle escalada l'étroit escalier en colimaçon et parvint à une petite porte. Dans la serrure, il y avait une clé rouillée. Elle la tourna. La porte s'ouvrit brusquement. Une vieille femme filant son lin avec application était assise dans une petite chambre.« Bonjour, grand-mère, dit la jeune fille. Que fais-tu là ?— Je file, dit la vieille en branlant la tête.— Qu'est-ce donc que cette chose que tu fais bondir si joyeusement ? » demanda la jeune fille.Elle s'empara du fuseau et voulut filer à son tour. À peine l'eut-elle touché que le mauvais sort s'accomplit : elle se piqua au doigt. À l'instant même, elle s'affaissa sur un lit qui se trouvait là et tomba dans un profond sommeil. Et ce sommeil se répandit sur l'ensemble du château. Le roi et la reine, qui venaient tout juste de revenir et pénétraient dans la grande salle du palais, s'endormirent. Et avec eux, toute la cour. Les chevaux s'endormirent dans leurs écuries, les chiens dans la cour, les pigeons sur le toit, les mouches contre les murs. Même le feu qui brûlait dans l'âtre s'endormit et le rôti s'arrêta de rôtir. Le cuisinier, qui était en train de tirer les cheveux du marmiton parce qu'il avait raté un plat, le lâcha et s'endormit. Et le vent cessa de souffler. Nulle feuille ne bougea plus sur les arbres devant le château. Tout autour du palais, une haie d'épines se mit à pousser, qui chaque jour devint plus haute et plus touffue. Bientôt, elle cerna complètement le château, jusqu'à ce qu'on n'en vît plus rien, même pas le drapeau sur le toit.  Dans le pays, la légende de la Belle au bois dormant — c'est ainsi que fut nommée la fille du roi — se répandait. De temps en temps, des fils de roi s'approchaient du château et tentaient d'y pénétrer à travers l'épaisse muraille d'épines. Mais ils n'y parvenaient pas. Les épines se tenaient entre elles, comme par des mains. Les jeunes princes y restaient accrochés, sans pouvoir se détacher et mouraient là, d'une mort cruelle.Au bout de longues, longues années, le fils d'un roi passa par le pays. Un vieillard lui raconta l'histoire de la haie d'épines. Derrière elle, il devait y avoir un château dans lequel dormait, depuis cent ans, la merveilleuse fille d'un roi, appelée la Belle au bois dormant. Avec elle dormaient le roi, la reine et toute la cour. Le vieil homme avait aussi appris de son grand-père que de nombreux princes étaient déjà venus et avaient tenté de forcer la haie d'épines ; mais ils y étaient restés accrochés et y étaient morts d'une triste mort. Le jeune homme dit alors : « Je n'ai peur de rien, je vais y aller. Je veux voir la Belle au bois dormant. »Le bon vieillard voulut l'en empêcher, mais il eut beau faire, le prince ne l'écouta pas. Or, les cent années étaient justement écoulées et le jour était venu où la Belle au bois dormant devait se réveiller. Lorsque le fils du roi s'approcha de la haie d'épines, il vit de magnifiques fleurs qui s'écartaient d'elles-mêmes sur son passage et lui laissaient le chemin. Derrière lui, elles reformaient une haie. Dans le château, il vit les chevaux et les chiens de chasse tachetés qui dormaient. Sur le toit, les pigeons se tenaient la tête sous l'aile. Et lorsqu'il pénétra dans le palais, il vit les mouches qui dormaient contre les murs. Le cuisinier, dans la cuisine, avait encore la main levée comme s'il voulait attraper le marmiton et la bonne était assise devant une poule noire qu'elle allait plumer. En haut, sur les marches du trône, le roi et la reine étaient endormis. Le prince poursuivit son chemin et le silence était si profond qu'il entendait son propre souffle. Enfin, il arriva à la tour et poussa la porte de la petite chambre où dormait la Belle.Elle était là, si jolie qu'il ne put en détourner le regard. Il se pencha sur elle et lui donna un baiser. Alors, la Belle au bois dormant s'éveilla, ouvrit les yeux et le regarda en souriant. Ils sortirent tous deux et le roi s'éveilla à son tour, et la reine, et toute la cour. Et tout le monde se regardait avec de grands yeux.Dans les écuries, les chevaux se dressaient sur leurs pattes et s'ébrouaient ; les chiens de chasse bondirent en remuant la queue. Sur le toit, les pigeons sortirent la tête de sous leur aile, regardèrent autour d'eux et s'envolèrent vers la campagne.

Et ils vécurent heureux jusqu'à leur mort.\n",

      "  Dans une île se dressait une haute montagne dont les flancs étaient recouverts d'une épaisse forêt. Au sommet de la montagne, une somptueuse demeure abritait des diables qui, lorsqu'ils se promenaient dans la forêt, en chassaient les hommes qu'ils croisaient. Il y a bien longtemps, neuf de ces diables descendirent la montagne et explorèrent le bord de la mer. Ils virent une barque sur la plage et décidèrent de prendre la mer. Dans l'embarcation se trouvaient des cannes à pêche, et ils parvinrent à pêcher des poissons. Depuis, toutes les nuits ils retournaient pêcher en mer. Le propriétaire de la barque remarqua que, lorsqu'il la prenait chaque matin, elle était sale et pleine de poissons morts. Intrigué, il décida de se cacher une nuit pour voir qui l'empruntait. Craignant que l'attente soit longue, il avait apporté des noix de coco à manger. Cela faisait une heure qu'il s'était caché derrière des arbres sur la plage, quand il vit les neuf diables s'approcher de sa barque.Il fut terrorisé lorsqu'ils s'avancèrent vers lui, car ils avaient senti l'odeur de la chair humaine. Pour tenter de les amadouer, il leur offrit ses noix de coco. Ils acceptèrent, et se régalèrent. Ils dirent au pêcheur qu'ils n'avaient jamais rien mangé d'aussi bon. Ils partirent tous ensemble à la pêche et, au retour, ils partagèrent le poisson.  Mais les diables voulaient encore des noix de coco ! Le pêcheur les emmena chez lui, où il avait une réserve, et ils mangèrent encore une grande quantité de noix de coco. Pour remercier le pêcheur, ils lui proposèrent de les accompagner dans leur maison, tout en haut de la montagne. Le pêcheur répondit que c'était trop loin, qu'il était trop fatigué pour faire autant de chemin et que, s'il venait, il ne pourrait pas retourner pêcher le lendemain.« Le chemin qui conduit à notre maison, lui dirent-ils, n'est pas un chemin comme celui qu'empruntent les hommes. Tu ne seras pas fatigué après être venu chez nous. »  Ils rejoignirent la forêt et, devant un grand arbre, ils s'arrêtèrent. L'un des diables fit un signe, et une porte s'ouvrit. Une fois que tous furent rentrés à l'intérieur, la porte se referma.  « Nous voici à la maison, dit l'un des diables. Il est possible que tu rencontres notre mère. Surtout, n'accepte rien de ce qu'elle te propose, à l'exception d'une branche morte, car elle a le don de guérir de tous les maux. » En effet, quelques instants plus tard, le pêcheur rencontra la mère des diables. C'était une géante très âgée, mais très gentille.Lorsqu'il fut l'heure de repartir, la mère des diables offrit au pêcheur une coupe en or qui ne se vidait jamais. Bien sûr il la refusa. Elle lui proposa ensuite un coq, avec une tête d'homme, qui donnait autant d'argent qu'on lui en demandait. Il refusa de nouveau et dit : « Donne-moi plutôt ce qui se trouve dans ce grand coffre ! »La vieille femme ouvrit le coffre et en sortit une branche qu'elle tendit au pêcheur en disant :« C'est une branche morte. Garde-la bien précieusement. » Après avoir remercié ses hôtes, il repartit comme il était venu. Une fois arrivé à sa cabane, il cacha soigneusement la branche morte. Quelques jours après, il vit passer des femmes en pleurs. Il leur demanda des explications. Elles lui répondirent qu'elles allaient chercher de l'eau pour donner le dernier bain au fils du chef de la tribu, qui était en train de mourir. Il leur dit que peut-être il pourrait le guérir. Rapportant ces paroles au père de l'enfant, ce dernier demanda à ce qu'on fasse venir le pêcheur le plus vite possible. Il arriva, mais trop tard. Le fils du chef venait juste de mourir. Tout le monde se mit à pleurer. Le pêcheur s'approcha et posa la branche morte sur la poitrine de l'enfant. Aussitôt, ce dernier se releva et fut bien surpris de voir tout le monde en pleurs autour de lui. Le pêcheur fut félicité et choyé. La nouvelle de cette guérison miraculeuse se répandit dans le pays, alors beaucoup de gens devinrent envieux et voulurent s'emparer de la branche morte. Plusieurs fois, on tenta de la lui voler.  Mais un jour, alors qu'il rentrait de la pêche, il vit des flammes et de la fumée en direction de sa maison. Celle-ci brûlait, et il vit en haut du toit, qui était encore épargné par le feu, sa branche morte. Le pêcheur réussit à la sauver des flammes, mais les envieux cherchèrent encore à lui voler sa branche.  Un jour, excédé, il leur dit : « Pourquoi voulez-vous me prendre cette branche qui vous assure de rester en bonne santé ? Si vous persistez, je la jetterai, et personne ne pourra la retrouver. »  Ils ne tinrent pas compte de ses mises en garde et continuèrent à l'importuner. Alors, il alla se débarrasser de la branche dans la forêt.  C'est pourquoi les hommes doivent mourir tandis que les arbres de la forêt, eux, sont immortels. Les poissons vivent dans l'eau. Ils se déplacent grâce à leurs nageoires et respirent avec leurs branchies. La plupart des poissons ont un corps couvert d'écailles et pondent des œufs.Ils possèdent des aspects différents selon qu'ils aiment se déplacer rapidement ou rester tranquillement au fond de l'eau. Certains ont même perdu leurs nageoires à force de ne pas bouger ! Il existe des milliers de poissons : requins, barracudas, raies, poissons-clown, saumons, sardines…   Chaque jour, à bord de leurs bateaux de pêche, appelés les chalutiers, de nombreux pêcheurs partent en mer et lancent dans l'eau leurs grands filets, les chaluts.Une fois les filets pleins de poissons et de crustacés, ils sont hissés sur le bateau.Les pêcheurs rentrent ensuite au port pour vendre leurs poissons tout juste pêchés, c'est la criée.Le lendemain, on peut retrouver ces poissons bien frais chez le poissonnier !   Où vivent les diables ?  Que désigne le mot « flanc » ?  Combien de diables partent à la pêche ?  Les diables se régalent en mangeant des :  Qu'est-ce qui a le don de guérir tous les maux ?  Quels poissons ne vivent pas dans l'eau des lacs ou des rivières ?  Quels poissons mange-t-on ?

      "  Depuis quelque temps, à chaque fois qu'un homme du campement partait chasser en kayak vers l'est, il n'en revenait jamais. Le seul d'entre eux à ne s'y être jamais aventuré, Kiviuq, était désormais l'unique chasseur et devait nourrir toute la communauté : femmes, enfants et aînés. Bien que très vaillant, il ne pouvait malheureusement pas assumer cette lourde tâche à lui seul et les ventres commençaient à se creuser.Un jour, prenant son courage à deux mains, il décida de partir à la recherche des siens.Il navigua longtemps vers l'est et alors qu'il manœuvrait pour contourner une île, il entendit soudain qu'on l'appelait :« Hé l'homme, approche, viens par ici ! »Il vit une vieille femme qui portait un enfant dans la poche dorsale de son manteau.Méfiant, il répondit :« Non, je ne viendrai pas.— Allez, quoi, viens », insista-t-elle.Il se dit qu'il ne risquait probablement pas grand-chose face à cette femme. Elle semblait inoffensive : elle était seule et ne portait pas d'armes. Comme elle insistait, il accosta.« Apporte ton kayak avec toi, qu'il ne dérive pas, ajouta-t-elle.— Non, je ne l'apporterai pas.— Allez, quoi, apporte-le. »Et comme elle insistait, il l'apporta.« Vide-le maintenant.— Non, je ne le viderai pas.—Allez, quoi, vide-le. »Comme elle insistait, il le vida.« Retourne ton kayak.— Non, je ne le retournerai pas.— Allez, quoi, retourne-le.»Comme elle insistait, il le retourna.« Mets cette pierre dans ton kayak pour qu'il ne s'envole pas.— Non, je ne mettrai pas cette pierre dessus.— Allez, quoi, mets cette pierre. »Comme elle insistait, il la mit.« Maintenant, entre chez moi te réchauffer.— Non, je n'entrerai pas.Allez, quoi, entre chez moi. »Comme elle insistait, il entra.« Enlève tes vêtements de fourrure.— Non !— Allez, quoi, enlève-les. »Comme elle insistait, il les enleva.« Et maintenant tes bottes de peau, tes kamiik.— Non !— Allez, quoi, enlève-les. »Et l'homme finit par se retrouver quasiment nu.La femme pendit vêtements et bottes pour les faire sécher.« Mais qu'allons-nous donner à manger à notre invité ? » demanda-t-elle au bébé qu'elle portait dans son dos.Elle nettoya un grand plateau et sortit chercher de la nourriture.  Une fois seul, Kiviuq regarda autour de lui et comprit avec effroi que c'était elle qui avait tué tous ses compagnons. Leurs dépouilles et la peau de leurs visages étaient accrochées sur les parois de la tente et servaient de décorations.Quelques instants plus tard, la femme rentra avec un sac de baies sauvages. « Vas-y, mange » ordonna-t-elle à son invité.L'homme plongea la main dans le sac pour se servir mais il sentit quelque chose de dur dans le fond. Il l'extirpa du sac et découvrit avec dégoût qu'il s'agissait d'une main humaine bouillie.« Je ne peux pas manger ça, dit-il.— Mais si, allez, mange, c'est délicieux avec les petites baies. »L'homme replongea la main dans le sac mais prit soin de ne choisir que les fruits. Quand vint le soir, ils allèrent se coucher.L'homme feignit de s'endormir. Lorsqu'il faisait semblant de ronfler, la femme prenait son couteau, mais dès qu'il faisait mine de se réveiller, il entendait le cliquetis d'une lame métallique qui tombait au sol. Il résista longtemps au sommeil et la femme finit par s'endormir.Alors, sans un bruit, l'homme récupéra ses vêtements, mit ses kamiik, prit son kayak sous le bras et s'élança vers le rivage. Mais, comme il courait vers la mer, la femme, réveillée, surgit de sous la tente. Elle se lança à sa poursuite et le rattrapa rapidement. Elle avait atteint la poupe de son kayak quand il donna son premier coup de pagaie. La femme tomba la tête la première dans l'eau glacée. Le temps qu'elle se relève et retrouve ses esprits, l'homme était déjà bien loin.Il pagaya de toutes ses forces jusqu'au campement sans se retourner et raconta son histoire.« Je sais pourquoi nos chasseurs disparaissent quand ils partent vers l'est ; il y a là-bas une femme dévoreuse d'hommes. Elle se nourrit de leur chair et décore sa tente de leurs dépouilles ! »L'homme rêva toute la nuit de la femme cannibale et le lendemain, au lever du jour, il retourna la voir, décidé à venger ses amis disparus. Dès qu'il fut à proximité de l'île, la femme l'appela comme elle l'avait fait la veille : « Hé l'homme, approche, viens par ici ! » Mais il lui répondit : « C'est toi qui as voulu me tuer hier.— Non, ce n'est pas moi. C'est l'enfant que je porte sur le dos. Mais ne t'inquiète pas, je vais l'en empêcher cette fois-ci ! Allez viens ! »Mais l'homme lui rétorqua : « Je n'ai pas confiance ; Et d'ailleurs, pourquoi l'enfant que tu portes dans ton amauti a-t-il des ongles horribles, longs et pointus et pourquoi te regarde-t-il si étrangement ? Il est effrayant ! »La femme, terrorisée, attrapa l'enfant et, sans même le regarder, le jeta au loin. Il tomba dans la mer et lorsqu'il toucha l'eau, ses sourcils se transformèrent en moules bleues, ses entrailles en algues et ses cheveux en plantes aquatiques.La vieille femme, furieuse contre le chasseur, ordonna à son couteau : « Couteau, transperce-le ! » Et aussitôt, le couteau de la femme fendit l'air en direction du chasseur. Mais se tenant sur ses gardes, celui-ci réussit à amortir le coup. Blessé au bras, il répliqua avec force : « Harpon, transperce-la ! »Son harpon vola vers la femme qui s'effondra sous la violence du choc. « Couteau, transperce-le vraiment cette fois ! », s'écria-t-elle à nouveau. Le couteau heurta l'homme de plein fouet et le blessa grièvement. Mais, rassemblant ses forces une dernière fois, il cria : « Que mon harpon te transperce à mort ! »Et la femme s'écroula. Avant de succomber à ses blessures, elle jeta une dernière fois son couteau vers l'homme en hurlant : « Qu'il meure ! »Mais le couteau ne put atteindre le chasseur car ce dernier était déjà loin. Blessé et exténué, il trouva malgré tout la force de rejoindre les siens.L'histoire s'achève ainsi. À partir de ce jour, les gens du campement purent partir vers l'est ; et en revenir. Le peuple inuit se répartit sur plusieurs territoires : la Sibérie orientale, l'Alaska, le Canada et le Groenland. La langue d'origine est l'inuktitut (dans cette langue, « inuit » est un mot au pluriel qui signifie « les hommes ») mais les Inuit parlent également la langue nationale du territoire sur lequel ils se trouvent. Le mode de vie traditionnel des Inuit consiste à vivre de la chasse et de la pêche. Ils se déplacent en traîneaux à chiens sur terre et en kayak sur l'eau et vivent dans des igloos ou des tentes en peau de phoque. Ils chassent essentiellement le phoque, l'ours et la baleine. Ces animaux fournissent à la fois la nourriture (viande), la peau pour fabriquer les tentes et les vêtements, la graisse pour chauffer et éclairer.  Dans ce conte, la femme dévore les hommes. Elle se sert de leur peau pour :  Dans quelles parties du globe les Inuit vivent-ils ?  Comment les Inuit se déplacent-ils ?  De quoi sont recouvertes les tentes des Inuit ?  Quel est l'habitat traditionnel du peuple Inuit ?    Depuis quelque temps, à chaque fois qu'un homme du campement partait chasser en kayak vers l'est, il n'en revenait jamais. Le seul d'entre eux à ne s'y être jamais aventuré, Kiviuq, était désormais l'unique chasseur et devait nourrir toute la communauté : femmes, enfants et aînés.

Comme elle insistait, il accosta.« Apporte ton kayak avec toi, qu'il ne dérive pas, ajouta-t-elle.— Non, je ne l'apporterai pas.— Allez, quoi, apporte-le. »Et comme elle insistait, il l'apporta.« Vide-le maintenant.— Non, je ne le viderai pas.—Allez, quoi, vide-le. »Comme elle insistait, il le vida.« Retourne ton kayak.— Non, je ne le retournerai pas.— Allez, quoi, retourne-le.»Comme elle insistait, il le retourna.« Mets cette pierre dans ton kayak pour qu'il ne s'envole pas.— Non, je ne mettrai pas cette pierre dessus.— Allez, quoi, mets cette pierre. »Comme elle insistait, il la mit.« Maintenant, entre chez moi te réchauffer.— Non, je n'entrerai pas.Allez, quoi, entre chez moi. »Comme elle insistait, il entra.« Enlève tes vêtements de fourrure.— Non !— Allez, quoi, enlève-les. »Comme elle insistait, il les enleva.« Et maintenant tes bottes de peau, tes kamiik.— Non !— Allez, quoi, enlève-les. »Et l'homme finit par se retrouver quasiment nu.La femme pendit vêtements et bottes pour les faire sécher.« Mais qu'allons-nous donner à manger à notre invité ? » demanda-t-elle au bébé qu'elle portait dans son dos.Elle nettoya un grand plateau et sortit chercher de la nourriture.  Une fois seul, Kiviuq regarda autour de lui et comprit avec effroi que c'était elle qui avait tué tous ses compagnons. Leurs dépouilles et la peau de leurs visages étaient accrochées sur les parois de la tente et servaient de décorations.Quelques instants plus tard, la femme rentra avec un sac de baies sauvages. « Vas-y, mange » ordonna-t-elle à son invité.L'homme plongea la main dans le sac pour se servir mais il sentit quelque chose de dur dans le fond. Il l'extirpa du sac et découvrit avec dégoût qu'il s'agissait d'une main humaine bouillie.« Je ne peux pas manger ça, dit-il.— Mais si, allez, mange, c'est délicieux avec les petites baies. »L'homme replongea la main dans le sac mais prit soin de ne choisir que les fruits. Quand vint le soir, ils allèrent se coucher.L'homme feignit de s'endormir. Lorsqu'il faisait semblant de ronfler, la femme prenait son couteau, mais dès qu'il faisait mine de se réveiller, il entendait le cliquetis d'une lame métallique qui tombait au sol. Il résista longtemps au sommeil et la femme finit par s'endormir.Alors, sans un bruit, l'homme récupéra ses vêtements, mit ses kamiik, prit son kayak sous le bras et s'élança vers le rivage. Mais, comme il courait vers la mer, la femme, réveillée, surgit de sous la tente. Elle se lança à sa poursuite et le rattrapa rapidement. Elle avait atteint la poupe de son kayak quand il donna son premier coup de pagaie. La femme tomba la tête la première dans l'eau glacée. Le temps qu'elle se relève et retrouve ses esprits, l'homme était déjà bien loin.Il pagaya de toutes ses forces jusqu'au campement sans se retourner et raconta son histoire.« Je sais pourquoi nos chasseurs disparaissent quand ils partent vers l'est ; il y a là-bas une femme dévoreuse d'hommes. Elle se nourrit de leur chair et décore sa tente de leurs dépouilles ! »L'homme rêva toute la nuit de la femme cannibale et le lendemain, au lever du jour, il retourna la voir, décidé à venger ses amis disparus. Dès qu'il fut à proximité de l'île, la femme l'appela comme elle l'avait fait la veille : « Hé l'homme, approche, viens par ici ! » Mais il lui répondit : « C'est toi qui as voulu me tuer hier.— Non, ce n'est pas moi. C'est l'enfant que je porte sur le dos. Mais ne t'inquiète pas, je vais l'en empêcher cette fois-ci ! Allez viens ! »Mais l'homme lui rétorqua : « Je n'ai pas confiance ; Et d'ailleurs, pourquoi l'enfant que tu portes dans ton amauti a-t-il des ongles horribles, longs et pointus et pourquoi te regarde-t-il si étrangement ? Il est effrayant ! »La femme, terrorisée, attrapa l'enfant et, sans même le regarder, le jeta au loin. Il tomba dans la mer et lorsqu'il toucha l'eau, ses sourcils se transformèrent en moules bleues, ses entrailles en algues et ses cheveux en plantes aquatiques.La vieille femme, furieuse contre le chasseur, ordonna à son couteau : « Couteau, transperce-le ! » Et aussitôt, le couteau de la femme fendit l'air en direction du chasseur. Mais se tenant sur ses gardes, celui-ci réussit à amortir le coup. Blessé au bras, il répliqua avec force : « Harpon, transperce-la ! »Son harpon vola vers la femme qui s'effondra sous la violence du choc. « Couteau, transperce-le vraiment cette fois ! », s'écria-t-elle à nouveau. Le couteau heurta l'homme de plein fouet et le blessa grièvement. Mais, rassemblant ses forces une dernière fois, il cria : « Que mon harpon te transperce à mort ! »Et la femme s'écroula. Avant de succomber à ses blessures, elle jeta une dernière fois son couteau vers l'homme en hurlant : « Qu'il meure ! »Mais le couteau ne put atteindre le chasseur car ce dernier était déjà loin. Blessé et exténué, il trouva malgré tout la force de rejoindre les siens.L'histoire s'achève ainsi. À partir de ce jour, les gens du campement purent partir vers l'est ; et en revenir.\n",

      "  Il était une fois quatre garnements aux noms prédestinés. Ils s'appelaient Sans-Souci, Sans-le-Sou, Propre-à-Rien et Meurt-de-Faim. Ils vivaient au gré de leurs envies, dormant la plupart du temps et ne s'éveillant que pour obtenir en mendiant le peu qui leur était nécessaire pour survivre. Mangeant peu, ne se lavant pas, ils n'étaient pas beaux à voir et n'inspiraient aucune confiance à qui avait le malheur de les croiser. Or, voilà qu'un jour, alors qu'un orage d'une violence inouïe éclatait, un pauvre étranger perdu leur demanda l'asile en attendant que le ciel ait déversé son trop-plein de colère. Bons bougres tout de même, ils le laissèrent entrer dans leur misérable hutte. À la fin du déluge, l'étranger les quitta, non sans leur promettre de leur envoyer à chacun une boîte dont ils devraient prendre grand soin et dans laquelle ils trouveraient quelque chose à planter. Lorsque les boîtes arrivèrent, ils obéirent et plantèrent ce qu'ils y trouvèrent : plants de vigne et de figuier, noyaux d'amandes et de noisettes. Le terrain était inculte, mais les arbres y poussaient, et les quatre mauvais sujets apprirent même à en sécher les fruits. Ceux-ci, plus tard, entrèrent dans la composition de leur dessert d'hiver, qu'ils vendirent avec succès.

Mélange bien avec un fouet ou une fourchette. Verse le sucre en poudre, le pralin, la farine et la levure. Avec l'aide d'un adulte, fais fondre le chocolat dans le lait (dans une casserole ou au micro-ondes). Verse le chocolat fondu dans le saladier et mélange bien le tout.

      "  La lionne avait mis bas neuf petits. Un jour, à son retour de la chasse, elle n'en trouva plus que huit : l'hyène était venue lui en enlever un.Le lendemain, un autre lionceau avait disparu, le surlendemain, un troisième manquait. Le quatrième jour, au moment de partir pour la chasse, la lionne dit à ses petits : « Je voudrais bien savoir qui est venu ici enlever vos frères ; aussi vais-je me cacher non loin de vous. Quand il se présentera, criez tous ensemble pour m'avertir. »Elle alla s'embusquer et n'eut pas à attendre longtemps l'arrivée de l'hyène. La lionne accourut, rapide comme une flèche, aux cris de ses petits. Elle bondit sur le ravisseur et l'amputa des quatre membres. Puis elle la laissa ainsi mutilée, se promettant de l'achever à son retour.L'hyène se traîna sur ses moignons jusqu'à son terrier où elle trouva ses sujets réunis, car elle commandait à la brousse.En revenant de la chasse, la lionne chercha vainement l'hyène pour lui donner le coup de grâce. Elle alla trouver un singe et lui dit : « Toi qui es un promeneur enragé, tu connais le repaire de l'hyène. Il faut m'y conduire sur-le-champ ! »  Le singe mena la lionne chez l'hyène. Le lièvre était en train de jouer de sa diouroukelé, une guitare à une corde. Il chantait en même temps et le siéménéouâra, le grand chat de la brousse, répondait à ses questions en chantant lui aussi.« Quelle est cette peau ? demandait le lièvre.— C'est, répondait le siéménéouâra, la peau de telle bête que notre chef a dévorée !— Et celle-ci ?— La peau de tel autre animal englouti par notre chef. »À l'entrée de la lionne, tous les sujets de l'hyène, épouvantés, voulurent prendre la fuite.« Que nul ne bouge ! gronda la lionne, ou j'étrangle tout le monde. »« Continue ! ordonna la lionne au lièvre qui avait interrompu son chant, continue si tu ne veux pas que je te mange ! »Le lièvre reprit alors « Quelle est cette peau-là ? » Pas de réponse ! « Quelle est cette peau-là ? » Personne encore ne répondait.« Passe-moi ta diouroukelé », dit alors la lionne. Elle se mit à jouer et chanta elle-même les questions : « Quelle est cette peau-là ? Réponds-moi, lièvre, toi qui interrogeais tout à l'heure ! »Et le lièvre répondit : « C'est la peau du zèbre dont notre chef a fait sa proie… C'est la peau de la biche que notre chef a dévorée… »Arrivée aux peaux des trois lionceaux : « Quelles sont ces peaux ? gronda la lionne.— Ce sont, dit le lièvre, des peaux de mmmm.— Qu'appelles-tu des peaux de mmmm ? Ça n'existe pas ! Quelles sont ces peaux encore une fois ? Dis-le-moi distinctement, ou je te brise les reins.— Ce sont les peaux de tes petits ! » murmura le lièvre secoué de frissons d'épouvante.À ces mots, la lionne, au comble de la fureur, étrangla les animaux présents les uns après les autres et se réserva l'hyène pour le dessert.Le carnage terminé, la lionne sortit et, rencontrant les bêtes de la brousse, leur commanda d'aller, chacune de son côté, lui chercher à manger. Et toutes revinrent avec des victuailles : le lièvre avait volé pour elle des arachides ; le chat lui apportait des poulets dérobés ; le singe, des tomates… Seul le bouc n'avait rien trouvé. Le bouc remercia chaleureusement la vieille et partit, muni de son grigri. Arrivé dans la forêt, il aperçut un sanglier. Il le visa avec sa barbiche et le sanglier tomba raide mort. Puis ce fut le tour d'une biche.Il apporta à la lionne le produit de sa chasse : « Comment as-tu fait pour te procurer tout ce gibier ? lui demanda-t-elle. Comment as-tu pu tuer le sanglier ? C'est un animal qui parfois m'effraye moi-même !— C'est que je possède un grigri, répondit le bouc. Que je braque ma barbiche vers quelqu'un et il tombe mort sur-le-champ !— L'as-tu déjà dirigée de mon côté ? demanda la lionne assez peu rassurée.— Pas encore ! Mais je vais le faire ! — N'en fais rien ! s'écria la lionne. Je te rends la liberté d'aller où il te plaira ! »Et elle s'enfuit en criant toujours : « Ne te tourne pas de mon côté ! Ne te tourne pas de mon côté ! »Le bouc regagna le village des hommes et jamais plus ne s'aventura dans la brousse.  Dans l'histoire, qui est un « un promeneur enragé » ?  Dans l'histoire, quel animal apporte des poulets ?  Dans quel milieu vivent les lions et les hyènes ?  De quoi se nourrit le lion ?  À quoi sert la crinière du lion ?

      "  Au commencement, Dieu avait créé et mis sur Terre un seul homme et une seule femme.Un jour, il les interrogea :« Que préférez-vous, la mort de la Lune ou la mort du bananier ?— Seigneur, dirent-ils, nous ne comprenons pas.— Voulez-vous être comme la Lune, qui reste invisible tous les mois pendant quelques jours, mais qui réapparaît ensuite, ou préférez-vous être comme un bananier, qui meurt après avoir donné ses fruits ? »— Seigneur, expliquez-nous ce que cela signifie, car nous ne comprenons toujours pas !— Eh bien, voici : la Lune continue à exister par elle-même, bien qu'elle semble mourir tous les mois et ressusciter au bout de quelques jours, tandis que le bananier meurt tout à fait ; mais avant de mourir, il donne naissance à plusieurs rejetons qui lui succèdent. Choisissez ce que vous préférez, car il faut que vous vous décidiez pour une chose ou pour une autre. »Ils réfléchirent un peu, puis ils dirent :« Koezy Zanahary, nous préférons mourir comme le bananier, qui laisse après lui des successeurs. »C'est depuis lors, dit-on, que les hommes meurent, et qu'ils laissent des enfants pour les remplacer.  Sais-tu pourquoi la Lune semble différente au fil des jours ?Dans l'espace, la Lune reflète les rayons du Soleil, un peu comme un miroir. À chaque instant, une moitié de la Lune est éclairée, tandis que l'autre moitié est cachée. Comme elle tourne autour de la Terre, la Lune nous montre un morceau plus ou moins grand de sa face éclairée.De notre planète, nous voyons alors un croissant, une demi-lune ou un gros rond tout blond : la pleine lune.Chaque phase de la Lune a un nom.  Dans l'histoire, la Terre n'est peuplée que d'un seul homme et d'une seule femme.  Dans l'histoire, à quelle plante Dieu fait-il référence ?  Finalement, quelle mort l'homme et la femme choississent-ils ?  Les enfants sont, pour l'homme et la femme, ce que sont les fruits pour le bananier.  Parmi ces propositions, laquelle n'est pas une phase de la Lune ?    Au commencement, Dieu avait créé et mis sur Terre un seul homme et une seule femme.Un jour, il les interrogea :« Que préférez-vous, la mort de la Lune ou la mort du bananier ?— Seigneur, dirent-ils, nous ne comprenons pas.— Voulez-vous être comme la Lune, qui reste invisible tous les mois pendant quelques jours, mais qui réapparaît ensuite, ou préférez-vous être comme un bananier, qui meurt après avoir donné ses fruits ? »— Seigneur, expliquez-nous ce que cela signifie, car nous ne comprenons toujours pas !— Eh bien, voici : la Lune continue à exister par elle-même, bien qu'elle semble mourir tous les mois et ressusciter au bout de quelques jours, tandis que le bananier meurt tout à fait ; mais avant de mourir, il donne naissance à plusieurs rejetons qui lui succèdent.

      "  Il y a dans une province du Sénégal un village qui s'appelle Dêbou. Près de ce village, passe la rivière Falêmé. On y trouve une fosse d'un kilomètre de long. Aucun bateau ne peut passer à cet endroit, même les petites pirogues, car les génies des eaux les brisent toutes. Quant à y puiser de l'eau, il ne faut pas y songer non plus !Les génies des eaux de cet endroit sont appelés « mounous ». Ils ont, à peu de chose près, l'aspect d'êtres humains. Ils sont de différentes couleurs : noirs, rouges ou bien encore jaunes ou verts. Hommes et femmes portent des cheveux longs. Aux mains ils n'ont pas de pouces.À côté de la fosse, se trouve un champ appartenant à Oumar Fâno, un villageois de Dêbou. Toutes les nuits, les génies y venaient voler du mil. Le propriétaire du champ, ne pouvant le supporter plus longtemps, se promit d'éclaircir le mystère de ces vols.Il creusa un trou dans la terre puis le recouvrit de paille de façon à ce qu'on ne le vît pas. Le soir venu, il alla s'étendre dans cette cachette et attendit patiemment. Vers minuit, les mounous sortirent en quantité de l'eau et commencèrent à récolter le mil.Quand Oumar s'aperçut que les pillards ressemblaient à des êtres humains, il mit son fusil de côté, résolu à ne pas tirer sur eux. Mais profitant de ce qu'une des jeunes filles de la bande passait à portée de sa main, il l'empoigna par le pied et la retint malgré ses cris. Les autres mounous s'enfuirent et sautèrent dans l'eau précipitamment. Oumar emmena sa prisonnière chez lui et la prit pour femme. Elle travaillait avec courage et faisait tout ce qu'il lui commandait. Mais elle ne parlait à personne, pas même à son mari. À la maison, elle ne mangeait ni ne buvait. Elle attendit bientôt un bébé.  À cette époque, un voisin s'en vint trouver Oumar Fâno : « Comment ! lui dit-il, tu gardes près de toi une femme qui ne parle pas, ne boit pas, ne mange pas. À ta place, je la ramènerais où je l'ai trouvée.—Ainsi ferai-je dès demain ! », déclara Oumar, vexé par ces propos.Le lendemain soir en effet, il mena la mounou au bord de la rivière Falêmé : « Montre-moi de quel endroit de la rivière tu es sortie. » Elle lui désigna du doigt une place dans le fleuve. Alors, Oumar lui prit la main ; ils entrèrent ensemble dans l'eau et, dès qu'il en eut jusqu'aux genoux, il lui dit : « Retourne-t'en à l'endroit d'où tu viens ! »La mounou continua d'avancer lentement jusqu'à ce que l'eau lui vînt à la poitrine. Alors, se tournant vers Oumar, elle lui répondi : « Tu n'as pas de chance !—Pourquoi cela ?—Tu m'as gardée deux ans chez toi et pendant ce temps j'ai été ta femme. Et puis tu t'es fâché contre moi. Tu dois cependant bien te douter que, si je suis restée aussi longtemps près de toi, c'est parce que cela ne me déplaisait pas. Maintenant j'ai un enfant de toi et voici que tu m'abandonnes. Si tu m'avais gardée jusqu'à la naissance de cet enfant, alors j'aurais commencé à parler avec toi et je t'aurais appris beaucoup de choses. À présent, tout est fini car tu es trop impatient. Adieu ! »Elle disparut dans l'eau.Oumar Fâno rentra dans sa case, plein de remords. Jamais plus il ne revit celle avec qui il avait vécu heureux. Qu'est-ce que la Falêmé, d'après le conte ?

Elle attendit bientôt un bébé.  À cette époque, un voisin s'en vint trouver Oumar Fâno : « Comment ! lui dit-il, tu gardes près de toi une femme qui ne parle pas, ne boit pas, ne mange pas. À ta place, je la ramènerais où je l'ai trouvée.—Ainsi ferai-je dès demain ! », déclara Oumar, vexé par ces propos.Le lendemain soir en effet, il mena la mounou au bord de la rivière Falêmé : « Montre-moi de quel endroit de la rivière tu es sortie. » Elle lui désigna du doigt une place dans le fleuve. Alors, Oumar lui prit la main ; ils entrèrent ensemble dans l'eau et, dès qu'il en eut jusqu'aux genoux, il lui dit : « Retourne-t'en à l'endroit d'où tu viens ! »La mounou continua d'avancer lentement jusqu'à ce que l'eau lui vînt à la poitrine. Alors, se tournant vers Oumar, elle lui répondi : « Tu n'as pas de chance !—Pourquoi cela ?—Tu m'as gardée deux ans chez toi et pendant ce temps j'ai été ta femme. Et puis tu t'es fâché contre moi. Tu dois cependant bien te douter que, si je suis restée aussi longtemps près de toi, c'est parce que cela ne me déplaisait pas. Maintenant j'ai un enfant de toi et voici que tu m'abandonnes. Si tu m'avais gardée jusqu'à la naissance de cet enfant, alors j'aurais commencé à parler avec toi et je t'aurais appris beaucoup de choses. À présent, tout est fini car tu es trop impatient. Adieu ! »Elle disparut dans l'eau.Oumar Fâno rentra dans sa case, plein de remords. Jamais plus il ne revit celle avec qui il avait vécu heureux.\n",

      "  Un jeune garçon nommé Ségué Karanmbé était un oiseleur heureux. Chaque fois qu'il allait visiter ses pièges, il y trouvait de nombreux oiseaux capturés. Il avait attrapé toutes les espèces qui existent au monde, à l'exception d'une tourterelle à gorge noire que les Peuhls appellent kourkoundourôrou et les Bambara bourountouba-kanfi. Cette tourterelle-là avait esquivé tous ses pièges.  Renonçant à la capturer par ce moyen, le garçon prépara de la glu avec de l'écorce bouillie de ficus Puis il englua tous les arbres du pays. La tourterelle, qui ne connaissait pas ce piège, alla se poser sur une branche, et ses pattes furent prisonnières de la matière poisseuse.Ségué Karanmbé accourut pour s'emparer de sa victime.  « Jeune homme, lui dit l'oiseau, ton habileté a été plus grande que ma méfiance, mais si tu me laisses la vie sauve, je te donnerai quelque chose dont tu seras content, et ton père avec toi, car il ne sera plus obligé d'aller à la chasse avec son chien comme il le fait par tous les temps.— Et que veux-tu donc me donner de si précieux ?— Du bétail !— À quoi bon ? Je ne bois pas de lait !— Alors je t'offrirai de l'argent à profusion !— Ce n'est pas une chose qui se mange ! Ta chair est bien préférable pour moi ! »Et Ségué, impatient, saisit la tourterelle à la gorge.Celle-ci supplia alors d'une voix étouffée, car la pression des doigts la gênait fort pour parler : « Enfant, relâche-moi ! Je te promets une masse d'or aussi énorme qu'une montagne ! »À ces mots, Ségué desserra un peu son étreinte. Alors, l'oiseau pondit un œuf et dit au jeune homme : « Casse cet œuf, tu y trouveras une bague. Cette bague, mouille-la de ton sang. »  Quand Ségué eut cassé l'œuf, il aperçut à l'intérieur un petit anneau blanc. Il se fit alors une légère incision à la main et mouilla l'anneau avec le sang qui en coulait. L'anneau devint aussitôt jaune comme de l'or.« Passe cette bague à ton doigt, lui recommanda alors la tourterelle. Chaque fois que tu auras besoin de quelque chose, frappe le sol avec la paume de la main où se trouve le doigt qui porte l'anneau. Prononce en même temps le nom de ce que tu désires. Tu l'obtiendras à l'instant même !— Je vais en faire l'expérience sans plus attendre ! déclara Ségué. Si tu as menti, je te rôtirai sur la braise et te mangerai sans pitié ! »Il passa l'anneau à un doigt de sa main droite et, frappant le sol de la paume, il cria ce seul mot : « Bouillie ! » Cent calebasses de bouillie descendirent aussitôt de la colline.Après s'être rassasié, le jeune oiseleur dit à la tourterelle : « Il n'y a peut-être là qu'un effet de tes sortilèges. Je ne crois pas que ce soit la bague qui m'ait procuré cette bouillie. Je vais tenter une seconde expérience. » Alors, frappant la terre de nouveau, il appela : « Mon père ! Ma mère ! Venez manger de la bouillie ! » Aussitôt, il vit ses parents à ses côtés.Tous deux s'assirent et mangèrent, eux aussi, de grand appétit. « Petite tourterelle, dit alors Ségué, que ton anneau soit efficace ou non, tu m'as déjà donné plus de nourriture que ta chair ne m'en eût valu ! Aussi vais-je te laisser aller. Mais sache bien que si ta bague cessait de m'être utile, il me serait encore possible de remettre la main sur toi ! »  Sur ces mots, il délivra la tourterelle, qui s'enfuit à tire-d'aile. Ségué Karanmbé s'en retourna dans son village, accompagné de ses parents. Mais la marche fatiguait beaucoup ces derniers qui n'avaient pas pu se rendre compte de la longueur du chemin en venant, ayant été transportés par la vertu de l'anneau.Ségué, les voyant marcher péniblement, frappa la terre du plat de sa main en disant : « Il me faut trois chevaux alezans ! » Sur-le-champ, trois chevaux tout harnachés et dont la crinière et la queue étaient décorées de fils d'or, sortirent du sol à l'endroit même où Ségué avait frappé.Le jeune homme aida ses parents à enfourcher leurs montures, puis il grimpa à son tour sur la sienne. Ils revinrent chez eux en cet équipage.  Une fois chez lui, Ségué frappa encore le sol en souhaitant une case avec une terrasse très richement ornée. Et, à ce vœu, une case sortit de terre, aussi haute qu'une montagne et si solide qu'elle pouvait défier les assauts des tornades les plus furieuses. Toute la famille s'y installa. La mère de Ségué, pour remercier son fils, lui prépara une boisson à base de lait et de farine de mil. Le jeune homme, après avoir goûté de ce mélange, le trouva excellent : « Puisque ma bague peut me procurer tout ce que je désire, dit-il, je souhaite avoir moi-même du bétail qui me fournisse du lait ! » Il frappa le sol de sa paume et se trouva avoir des vaches en quantité. Le chef d'un village voisin, d'un naturel très envieux, apprit que Ségué possédait une bague merveilleuse. Il résolut de la lui enlever. Il marcha vers le village du jeune homme et l'investit avec ses guerriers. Alors, Ségué frappa de toutes ses forces un bloc de roche avec sa paume droite. « Je veux des guerriers géants, ordonna-t-il, pour me débarrasser de ces envahisseurs ! »De tous côtés arrivèrent des monstres énormes armés de lances et de fusils. Certains déracinaient des arbres pour s'en servir comme de gourdins. Ceux qui n'avaient pas d'armes s'étaient munis de rochers aussi gros que des cases. Ces guerriers se ruèrent sur les ennemis, en massacrèrent la plus grande partie et emportèrent leurs cadavres pour s'en repaître. Le reste des envahisseurs s'enfuit avec leur chef.Celui-ci, ne pouvant s'emparer par la force de l'anneau magique, résolut de se l'approprier par la ruse.  Dans ce but, il envoya l'aînée de ses filles au possesseur du talisman, en le priant d'accepter celle-ci comme épouse. Avant de mettre sa fille en route, il lui dit : « Tu sais que tu es fille d'un roi ! Et tu ne souhaites sûrement pas qu'il y ait en ce monde quelqu'un de plus puissant que ton père. Celui à qui je t'envoie a plus de pouvoir que moi, car il possède un anneau qui lui procure tout ce qu'il peut souhaiter. Quand il t'aura accueillie comme épouse, la septième nuit de votre mariage, fais le nécessaire pour t'emparer de l'anneau. Si tu ne veux pas que je te maudisse ! » Quand la jeune fille se présenta chez Ségué, elle lui plut tant qu'il l'accepta de grand cœur pour femme. Le septième soir, au moment d'aller dormir, elle dit à son mari :« Tout bon mari doit offrir des présents à son épouse. Je te donne cent captives, lui répondit Ségué.— Chez mon père, j'en avais deux cents, répliqua la jeune femme.— Je te ferai présent de bracelets pour tes bras et tes chevilles !— Il y en a à foison chez mon père !— En ce cas, que veux-tu de moi ?— La bague que je te vois au doigt.— Je ne te la donnerai certes pas !— Puisqu'il en est ainsi, laisse-moi m'en retourner à l'instant chez mon père ! »Ségué, désespéré de voir partir son épouse, céda.« Tiens, dit-il, voilà la bague ! Prends-la donc !— Maintenant que tu m'en as fait don, il te faut m'indiquer comment m'en servir.— Si le désir te vient de quelque chose, répondit Ségué, frappe la terre du plat de ta main en nommant à voix haute l'objet convoité. »La jeune femme, alors, frappa le sol de sa paume en disant : « Anneau de l'oiseleur, ramène-moi dans ma case ! »À l'instant même, elle se trouva transportée dans la case de son père, et tous les biens que Ségué avait obtenus grâce à la bague la suivirent, car ils ne pouvaient rester séparés de leur maîtresse. Le lendemain, la perfide épousée remit l'anneau à son père, et celui-ci fit ses préparatifs pour aller détruire le village de son gendre.« Nous revoici malheureux comme jadis ! dit Ségué à son père. La tourterelle va me le payer, car je la capturerai à nouveau. Elle a beau connaître le piège et la glu, elle ignore les collets de crin ! » Le chien du vieux chasseur intervint alors : « Ce n'est pas la peine de rattraper la tourterelle ! Je vais tâcher de récupérer ta bague. Laisse-moi faire ! » Le chien alla trouver un chat. « L'anneau de mon maître est à présent aux mains du chef du village voisin. Si, d'ici ce soir, je ne l'ai pas en ma possession, il n'y aura plus un chat vivant sur terre. » Le chat, à son tour, s'en alla trouver un rat. « Si l'anneau de Ségué passe la nuit chez le chef du village voisin, je mangerai tous les rats jusqu'au dernier ! » À minuit, trois rats se rendirent chez le chef du village voisin, qui dormait profondément. Le premier rat veilla à ce que personne n'entrât dans la case, le deuxième rat surveilla le sommeil du chef. Pendant ce temps, le troisième lui ôtait la bague du doigt. Quand il l'eut en sa possession, il alla promptement la remettre au chat. Celui-ci, à son tour, s'empressa de la porter au chien. Et le chien la rendit à Ségué Karanmbé.  Avec l'anneau revinrent toutes les richesses qui avaient disparu. De peur de se le voir soustraire de nouveau, Ségué le cousit dans un sachet qu'il suspendit à son cou, puis il dit : « Anneau, porte-moi loin des autres hommes, là où nul ne pourra m'attaquer. » En un clin d'œil, Ségué, sa famille et ses biens se virent transportés sur une montagne inaccessible et d'une prodigieuse hauteur, où ils vécurent longtemps heureux et tranquilles. Le matériel Un filet (celui des oranges, par exemple). De la margarine. Des graines (blé, orge, tournesol). Un élastique.  La réalisation1. Mets la margarine dans un bol. Ajoute les graines et mélange.2. Avec cette préparation, forme de petites boules et remplis-en le filet.3. Ferme le filet avec un élastique.4. Suspends ta mangeoire à une branche d'arbre. Maintenant, observe les oiseaux qui vont venir y picorer !  Dans l'histoire, quel oiseau se fait prendre au piège par Ségué ?  Dans l'histoire, qu'offre la tourterelle à Ségué en échange de sa liberté ?  Ségué partage sa bouillie avec :  « À tire-d'aile » et « promptement » signifient :  Pour défendre son village, Ségué fait apparaître :  La femme de Ségué souhaite qu'il lui offre :  Quels animaux aident Ségué à retrouver sa bague magique ?    Un jeune garçon nommé Ségué Karanmbé était un oiseleur heureux. Chaque fois qu'il allait visiter ses pièges, il y trouvait de nombreux oiseaux capturés.

      "  Il était une fois un prince qui voulait épouser une princesse, mais une vraie princesse. Il fit le tour de la Terre pour en trouver une mais il y avait toujours quelque chose qui clochait ; des princesses, il n'en manquait pas, mais étaient-elles de vraies princesses ? C'était difficile à apprécier ; toujours une chose ou l'autre ne lui semblait pas parfaite. Il rentra chez lui tout triste, il aurait tant voulu rencontrer une véritable princesse.Un soir, par un temps affreux, éclairs et tonnerre, cascades de pluie que c'en était effrayant, on frappa à la porte de la ville et le vieux roi lui-même alla ouvrir. C'était une princesse qui était là, dehors. Mais grands dieux ! de quoi avait-elle l'air dans cette pluie, par ce temps ! L'eau coulait de ses cheveux et de ses vêtements, entrait par la pointe de ses chaussures et ressortait par le talon… et elle prétendait être une véritable princesse ! « Nous allons bien voir ça », pensait la vieille reine, mais elle ne dit rien. Elle alla dans la chambre à coucher, retira toute la literie et mit un petit pois au fond du lit ; elle prit ensuite vingt matelas qu'elle empila sur le petit pois et, par-dessus, elle mit encore vingt édredons en plumes d'eider. C'est là-dessus que la princesse devait coucher cette nuit-là. Au matin, on lui demanda comment elle avait dormi.« Affreusement mal, répondit-elle, je n'ai presque pas fermé l'œil de la nuit. Dieu sait ce qu'il y avait dans ce lit. J'étais couchée sur quelque chose de si dur que j'en ai des bleus et des noirs sur tout le corps ! C'est terrible ! »  Alors ils reconnurent que c'était une vraie princesse puisque, à travers les vingt matelas et les vingt édredons en plumes d'eider, elle avait senti le petit pois. Une peau aussi sensible ne pouvait être que celle d'une authentique princesse.Le prince la prit donc pour femme, sûr maintenant d'avoir trouvé une vraie princesse, et le petit pois fut exposé dans le cabinet des trésors d'art, où l'on peut encore le voir si personne ne l'a emporté. Et ceci est une vraie histoire. Pourquoi a t-on placé un petit pois au fond du lit de la princesse ?  Qu'a t-on empilé sur le lit de la princesse au petit pois ?  Qu'est ce que le petit pois ?  Quel mot signifie « sortir les petits pois de leur gousse » ?  Que veut dire « Avoir un petit pois dans la tête » ?    Il était une fois un prince qui voulait épouser une princesse, mais une vraie princesse. Il fit le tour de la Terre pour en trouver une mais il y avait toujours quelque chose qui clochait ; des princesses, il n'en manquait pas, mais étaient-elles de vraies princesses ?

      "  Une jeune princesse possédait toutes les qualités que l'on pût désirer. Ses yeux d'un bleu profond illuminaient un visage ravissant, et tout le monde admirait la façon qu'elle avait de raconter des histoires. Sa mère était morte à sa naissance, et son père l'adorait et ne lui refusait rien.La princesse cependant avait un défaut : se considérant comme une personne parfaite, elle exigeait que tout autour d'elle le fût également. Elle n'hésitait pas à jeter un gâteau si les fraises qui l'ornaient n'étaient pas toutes exactement de la même taille et de la même couleur ! Évidemment, aucun prétendant ne trouvait grâce à ses yeux. Son père insistait pour qu'elle se mariât, mais elle refusait tous les jeunes gens qu'il lui présentait. Un jour qu'il la suppliait de nouveau, elle lui promit qu'elle épouserait celui qui lui apporterait une rose bleue. Le père ne se réjouit pas de cette décision, car il savait bien que les roses bleues n'existent pas. Les roses sont blanches, rouges, roses ou jaunes, mais jamais bleues ! Cédant à l'exigence de sa fille, il fit annoncer dans tout le pays que le premier qui apporterait à la princesse une rose bleue, de la couleur de ses yeux, l'épouserait le jour même. Nombreux furent ceux qui partirent à la recherche de cette rose dans l'espoir de devenir le gendre de l'empereur ! Beaucoup abandonnèrent leur recherche. Seuls trois prétendants continuèrent leur quête. L'un d'eux était un riche marchand. Il alla voir un fleuriste et lui demanda de lui trouver une rose bleue, sinon il le tuerait. Le fleuriste désespéré utilisa un subterfuge pour sauver sa vie. Il trempa une rose blanche dans un liquide bleu, et la rose se teinta de la couleur désirée ! Quand le marchand revint voir le fleuriste, il le remercia et lui donna beaucoup d'argent. Il se précipita alors au palais pour montrer la rose bleue à la princesse et l'épouser. Le roi se réjouit à la vue de la fleur et dit à sa fille : « Tu dois tenir ta promesse ! Tu as la rose bleue que tu souhaitais, nous allons préparer le mariage. » Sa fille cependant avait deviné la ruse et répondit à son père : « Comment avez-vous pu vous laisser aussi facilement tromper ?  « Cette rose n'est bleue que parce qu'elle a été teintée ! Ce n'est pas sa couleur d'origine. » Elle demanda qu'on apporte un oiseau. Lorsque celui-ci se posa sur la rose, il mourut instantanément, tué par le poison qui avait servi à colorer la fleur. Le deuxième prétendant était un militaire qui se rendit dans la région des cinq fleuves, célèbre pour ses diamants. Il examina de nombreuses pierres précieuses et finit par trouver un très gros saphir bleu. Il l'acheta et le porta à un joaillier pour le faire tailler en forme de rose. Quand l'empereur vit le bijou, il le trouva magnifique et fut persuadé que sa fille accepterait de se marier avec ce militaire. Son père alla la chercher et lui dit : « Tu dois tenir ta promesse ! Tu as la rose bleue que tu souhaitais, nous allons préparer le mariage. » Quand elle vit la rose, la jeune femme s'écria : « Mais ce n'est pas une fleur ! Mon père, vous voyez bien que ce n'est qu'un saphir taillé en forme de fleur ! J'ai de bien plus beaux bijoux et j'attends toujours qu'on m'apporte une vraie rose bleue. »  Le troisième prétendant était un jeune noble de bonne famille. Il convoqua le plus réputé des peintres du pays et lui demanda de lui peindre la plus belle rose bleue qu'on pût imaginer. Quand le tableau fut achevé, il le porta à l'empereur, qui fut persuadé que, cette fois-ci, sa fille serait satisfaite, et qu'elle aurait enfin trouvé un mari. Son père alla la chercher et lui dit : « Tu dois tenir ta promesse ! Tu as la rose bleue que tu souhaitais, nous allons préparer le mariage. » La princesse répondit qu'elle voulait une rose vivante et non une image, aussi belle soit-elle. Le dernier prétendant fut donc refusé comme tous les autres.  Un soir d'été qu'elle admirait le coucher du soleil, elle entendit un poète chanter. C'était un beau jeune homme à la voix douce et harmonieuse. Elle descendit à sa rencontre. Elle s'éprit de lui, mais quand il lui dit qu'il souhaitait l'épouser, elle lui répondit : « Hélas, j'ai juré que je n'épouserais que celui qui serait capable de me rapporter une rose bleue. Jusqu'à présent, personne n'y est parvenu.— Moi j'y parviendrai. Ce n'est pas difficile, il y a partout des roses bleues. » Le lendemain, il arriva au palais avec une rose de couleur crème. Il la présenta à l'empereur, qui se moqua de lui. Il fit néanmoins appeler sa fille et lui dit : « Voilà ma fille un poète qui prétend avoir trouvé une rose bleue ! » À sa grande surprise, il entendit sa fille répondre : « Mais oui, mon père, elle est bleue, c'est la plus belle rose que j'ai jamais vue et elle est bien bleue. » Tout le monde à la cour partagea la stupéfaction de l'empereur. Tout le monde voyait une rose crème et non bleue ! Partout la princesse disait : « Je vous assure qu'elle est bleue. C'est vous qui ne voyez pas ! Elle est d'un bleu merveilleux, et je suis heureuse car je vais épouser celui qui me l'a rapportée. » Et ainsi fut fait. La princesse fut très heureuse et perdit l'habitude de rechercher en permanence la perfection.  En forêt, dans les prairies ou au bord des routes, partout on peut admirer de jolies fleurs aux couleurs et aux formes variées. Chacune possède des racines, une tige, des feuilles et des fleurs composées de pétales. Attention, certaines ont également des épines, comme les roses !À l'intérieur de la fleur, se développent des graines, qui, en tombant, peuvent donner à nouveau des fleurs. Étant donné leur grande fréquence, il est possible de cueillir les fleurs pour en faire des bouquets ou constituer des herbiers. Mais il faut veiller à couper leur tige proprement pour permettre à la plante de continuer à se développer.   La rose est la fleur des rosiers. Elle possède une multitude de pétales imbriqués les uns dans les autres, ce qui lui donne sa forme si reconnaissable. La rose peut prendre toutes sortes de couleurs : jaune, rose, rouge, blanc, etc. Dans le langage des fleurs, chaque couleur a une signification particulière. Ainsi, offrir une rose jaune traduit l'amitié et la joie ; une rose rose, la reconnaissance et la gentillesse ; une rose rouge, l'amour et la passion et une rose blanche le raffinement et la pureté.  Quelle fleur la princesse souhaite-t-elle recevoir ?  Dans l'histoire, quelle est la particularité de la rose ?  Un subterfuge est :  De quelle couleur est la rose du poète ?  Quel est l'intrus ?  Qu'offre-t-on traditionnellement le 1er mai ?    Une jeune princesse possédait toutes les qualités que l'on pût désirer. Ses yeux d'un bleu profond illuminaient un visage ravissant, et tout le monde admirait la façon qu'elle avait de raconter des histoires. Sa mère était morte à sa naissance, et son père l'adorait et ne lui refusait rien.La princesse cependant avait un défaut : se considérant comme une personne parfaite, elle exigeait que tout autour d'elle le fût également. Elle n'hésitait pas à jeter un gâteau si les fraises qui l'ornaient n'étaient pas toutes exactement de la même taille et de la même couleur ! Évidemment, aucun prétendant ne trouvait grâce à ses yeux. Son père insistait pour qu'elle se mariât, mais elle refusait tous les jeunes gens qu'il lui présentait. Un jour qu'il la suppliait de nouveau, elle lui promit qu'elle épouserait celui qui lui apporterait une rose bleue. Le père ne se réjouit pas de cette décision, car il savait bien que les roses bleues n'existent pas. Les roses sont blanches, rouges, roses ou jaunes, mais jamais bleues ! Cédant à l'exigence de sa fille, il fit annoncer dans tout le pays que le premier qui apporterait à la princesse une rose bleue, de la couleur de ses yeux, l'épouserait le jour même. Nombreux furent ceux qui partirent à la recherche de cette rose dans l'espoir de devenir le gendre de l'empereur ! Beaucoup abandonnèrent leur recherche. Seuls trois prétendants continuèrent leur quête. L'un d'eux était un riche marchand. Il alla voir un fleuriste et lui demanda de lui trouver une rose bleue, sinon il le tuerait. Le fleuriste désespéré utilisa un subterfuge pour sauver sa vie. Il trempa une rose blanche dans un liquide bleu, et la rose se teinta de la couleur désirée ! Quand le marchand revint voir le fleuriste, il le remercia et lui donna beaucoup d'argent. Il se précipita alors au palais pour montrer la rose bleue à la princesse et l'épouser. Le roi se réjouit à la vue de la fleur et dit à sa fille : « Tu dois tenir ta promesse ! Tu as la rose bleue que tu souhaitais, nous allons préparer le mariage. » Sa fille cependant avait deviné la ruse et répondit à son père : « Comment avez-vous pu vous laisser aussi facilement tromper ?  « Cette rose n'est bleue que parce qu'elle a été teintée ! Ce n'est pas sa couleur d'origine. » Elle demanda qu'on apporte un oiseau. Lorsque celui-ci se posa sur la rose, il mourut instantanément, tué par le poison qui avait servi à colorer la fleur. Le deuxième prétendant était un militaire qui se rendit dans la région des cinq fleuves, célèbre pour ses diamants. Il examina de nombreuses pierres précieuses et finit par trouver un très gros saphir bleu. Il l'acheta et le porta à un joaillier pour le faire tailler en forme de rose.

      "L'expédition de Jason et de la toison d'or est très célèbre. Jason fit construire un navire, l'Argo. Certains pensent qu'il s'agit du tout premier bateau créé. Il demanda ensuite l'aide de 50 héros grecs parmi les plus célèbres et les plus valeureux. Tous devinrent membres de l'équipage et furent baptisés les Argonautes. Parmi eux, il y avait Castor et Pollux (les fils jumeaux d'Hélène de Sparte), Orphée (célèbre musicien) et Pélée (le père d'Achille). Au cours du voyage, les Argonautes rencontrèrent de nombreux obstacles. L'histoire raconte les péripéties rencontrées par Jason et les Argonautes pour récupérer la fameuse Toison d'or.

      "Comme le fleuve se jetait dans la mer, la grenouille alla jusqu'au bord de la mer, et elle se mit à boire l'eau de la mer, à boire, à boire…, et elle la but jusqu'à la dernière goutte qui était la dernière goutte d'eau de toute la terre. Son ventre, ses pattes, sa tête étaient gorgés d'eau, et même ses yeux, qui devinrent tout globuleux. La petite grenouille était maintenant extraordinaire, gigantesque ; sa tête touchait le ciel ! Les plantes avaient soif, les animaux avaient soif, et les hommes aussi avaient terriblement soif. Alors tous se réunirent pour chercher un moyen de récupérer l'eau de la terre. « Il faut qu'elle ouvre sa large bouche afin que l'eau rejaillisse sur la terre. – Si on la fait rire, dit quelqu'un, elle ouvrira la bouche, et l'eau débordera.– Bonne idée » dirent les autres.Ils préparèrent alors une grande fête, et les animaux les plus drôles vinrent du monde entier. Les hommes firent les clowns, racontèrent des histoires drôles. En les regardant, les animaux oublièrent qu'ils avaient soif, les enfants aussi. Mais la grenouille ne riait pas, ne souriait même pas. Elle restait impassible, immobile. Les singes firent des acrobaties, des grimaces, dansèrent, firent les pitres. Mais la grenouille ne bougeait pas, ne riait pas, ne faisait même pas l'esquisse d'un sourire. Tous étaient épuisés, assoiffés, quand arriva une petite créature insignifiante, un petit ver de terre, qui s'approcha de la grenouille. Il se mit à se tortiller, à onduler. La grenouille le regarda étonnée. Le petit ver se démena autant qu'il put. Il fit une minuscule grimace, et… la grenouille éclata de rire, un rire énorme qui fit trembler tout son corps ! Elle ne pouvait plus s'arrêter de rire, et les eaux débordèrent de sa bouche grande ouverte. L'eau se répandit sur toute la terre, et la grenouille rapetissa, rapetissa.  La vie put recommencer, et la grenouille reprit sa taille de grenouille ordinaire. Elle garda juste ses gros yeux globuleux, en souvenir de cette aventure.  Pour savoir d'où vient la pluie, suivons le parcours d'une goutte d'eau. C'est une très grande voyageuse ! Sous l'effet des rayons du Soleil, l'eau de mer s'est réchauffée et une partie s'est évaporée. Une minuscule gouttelette s'échappe de l'eau et s'évapore vers le ciel, puis une autre et encore une autre. Il y en a tellement qu'on ne peut pas les compter ! Elles flottent toutes dans l'air, un peu comme la poussière lorsque l'on souffle dessus. Mais on ne les voit pas, le vent les pousse dans le ciel. Quand il fait froid, les gouttes se cognent les unes contre les autres. Elles deviennent grosses et lourdes, si lourdes qu'elles finissent par tomber : il pleut.L'eau de pluie tombe sur la terre, dans les rivières, sur les montagnes… Quand une goutte tombe dans un petit ruisseau, elle se fond dans l'eau et suit le courant. Après quelque temps, elle arrive dans une rivière plus grosse qui rejoint un fleuve, et finalement le fleuve se jette dans la mer. Il fait chaud, la gouttelette s'échappe à nouveau de la mer et s'évapore vers le ciel. Il y en a beaucoup d'autres dans l'air. De nouveaux nuages se forment… Attention, il va bientôt pleuvoir !

      "  Un pauvre brahmane, ayant femme et enfants, priait et faisait régulièrement des offrandes à la déesse Durga, l'épouse du dieu Siva. Un jour qu'il était dans la forêt à se lamenter sur sa misère, le dieu Siva et son épouse vinrent à se promener dans cette même forêt.La déesse appela le brahmane et lui fit présent d'un objet merveilleux qu'elle avait demandé pour lui à Siva. C'était un pot de terre qu'il suffisait de retourner pour en voir tomber, sans fin, de délicieux beignets sucrés, qu'on appelle mudki, dans ce pays.  Le brahmane remercia la déesse et s'empressa de reprendre le chemin de la maison. Il était encore loin de chez lui quand il eut l'idée d'essayer le pot de terre : il le retourna, et aussitôt en sortit une quantité de beignets, les plus beaux que le brahmane ait jamais vus. Vers midi, ayant faim, il s'apprêta à manger ses mudki, mais comme il n'avait pas fait ses ablutions ni dit ses prières, il s'arrêta dans une auberge près de laquelle se trouvait un étang. Il confia le pot de terre à l'aubergiste en lui recommandant à plusieurs reprises d'en prendre grand soin.  Pendant ce temps, l'aubergiste, qui avait été fort étonné de voir le brahmane attacher tant de prix à un simple pot de terre se mit à examiner l'objet. Comme il le retournait, il en tomba une pluie de beignets. L'aubergiste s'empara du pot magique et lui en substitua un autre d'apparence semblable. Ayant fini ses dévotions, le brahmane reprit son bien et se remit en route. Arrivé chez lui, il appela sa femme et ses enfants en leur promettant l'apparition de merveilles. Naturellement, ils ne virent rien du tout ! Le brahmane courut chez l'aubergiste et lui réclama son pot. L'autre feignit de s'indigner et mit le pauvre homme à la porte. Le brahmane retourna dans la forêt dans l'espoir de rencontrer encore la déesse Durga. Il la vit en effet, et elle lui donna un second pot de terre. Le brahmane l'essaya bien vite : il le retourna et il en sortit une vingtaine de démons d'une taille gigantesque et d'un aspect terrible, qui se mirent à le battre. Heureusement, celui-ci eut la présence d'esprit de retourner le pot et de le couvrir, ce qui les fit disparaître aussitôt.  Le brahmane retourna chez l'aubergiste et lui fit les mêmes recommandations que la première fois. L'aubergiste retourna le pot de terre, et il fut roué de coups, ainsi que toute sa famille. Il supplia le brahmane d'arrêter les démons. Celui-ci se fit rendre le premier pot de terre et fit ensuite disparaître les démons.  Le brahmane s'établit alors marchand de mudki, et gagna beaucoup d'argent. Le brahmaneEn Inde, un brahmane est un homme très important et très respecté. Il combat les maladies, considérées comme des punitions divines, en interprétant les pensées des dieux. Dans la culture européenne, un brahmane serait une sorte un prêtre. La déesse Durga et le dieu SivaDans la religion hindoue, Durga est la déesse de la guerre, mère de l'univers. Son combat contre le démon Mahîshâsura lui permit de ramener la joie et la paix aux habitants de la Terre. Depuis ce jour, Durga est vénérée par tous les hindous. Elle est mariée à Siva, un dieu qui détruit tout pour créer à nouveau. Il est généralement représenté avec un troisième œil au milieu du front et avec un cobra autour du cou. Les offrandesUne offrande est un cadeau offert à une divinité. Au temple, les hindous adressent des prières à leurs dieux et leur offrent, comme expression de leur dévotion, de la nourriture, de l'eau, ou des fleurs. La gastronomie indienneLa cuisine indienne est très variée. Beaucoup de plats végétariens sont parfumés avec un mélange d'épices (curcuma, tamarin, piment, cumin, gingembre, fenouil, etc.) appelé « curry ».Les indiens aiment aussi les desserts sucrés comme les beignets (mudki), les gâteaux (halwas) ou les crèmes glacées (kulfi).  Quel cadeau reçoit le pauvre brahmane ?  Quel est le nom de la déesse, femme de Siva ?  Les mudki sont :  Qui vole le pot de terre ?  Que contient le second pot de terre ?  À la fin de l'histoire, que fait le brahmane avec les beignets ?  À qui peut-on comparer le brahmane ?  Qu'est-ce qu'une offrande ?    Un pauvre brahmane, ayant femme et enfants, priait et faisait régulièrement des offrandes à la déesse Durga, l'épouse du dieu Siva.

      "  Le hérisson s'était associé avec le chacal pour cultiver. Des nomades s'installèrent un jour sur leurs terres. Quand le chacal et le hérisson s'en furent visiter leurs champs, ils y trouvèrent des chèvres broutant leur grain en herbe.« Amis, dirent-ils aux étrangers, vous nous portez tort ! Si Dieu vous guide dans la bonne voie, décampez de nos champs !— Nous n'en partirons pas ! » répondirent-ils.Et grande fut alors l'inquiétude de nos deux compères.Le chacal dit un jour au hérisson : « Tirons au sort : celui de nous deux qu'il désignera montera sur l'autre et nous irons razzier les chèvres des nomades ! »Le hérisson répondit : « Mets ta confiance en Dieu ! » Et ils tirèrent à la courte paille.Le sort désigna le hérisson qui fut ainsi choisi comme monture. Le chacal lui jeta la selle sur le dos, mais ne sut comment s'y prendre pour monter car elle arrivait jusqu'à terre.Le hérisson l'interpella : « Qu'as-tu à vouloir monter sur moi, lui dit-il, je suis si petit, si court. C'est sur toi que la selle ira : tu es grand et long !— Si c'est là ton désir, mets-la-moi. »La selle était à la taille du chacal, le hérisson mit le pied dans l'étrier et s'écria : « Je sais me servir de l'éperon ! »Et prenant la bride en main, le hérisson monté sur le chacal s'en fut chasser les chèvres de leurs champs.  Levant la tête, les nomades virent le hérisson à califourchon sur le chacal. Ils appelèrent les lévriers qui les prirent en chasse.Le chacal, effrayé, dit au hérisson : « Oncle Mhand ! Je t'en prie, lâche la bride, que je me sauve plus vite ; je sens les lévriers sur moi ! »Le hérisson, serrant plus fortement la bride, lui répondit : « Tranquillise-toi ; cette journée ne se passera pas sans toi ! »Ils allaient ainsi quand ils atteignirent une rivière ; le chacal la franchit mais le hérisson tomba sur place. Il alla alors se cacher sous une bouse de vache, tandis que le chacal disparaissait au loin.Pendant ce temps, les gens du douar célébraient un mariage. Les femmes qui étaient allées chercher du combustible trouvèrent l'oncle Mhand caché sous une bouse. Une vieille le ramassa : « Ô notre ennemi, lui dit-elle, c'est Dieu qui t'a fait prendre ! »  Elle le porta aux gens du douar.« Nous sommes occupés, lui dirent-ils ; il n'y a que toi pour le garder ! »Elle lui passa un collier et l'attacha au poteau de la tente, puis alla s'asseoir devant lui. Le hérisson fit semblant de pleurer.« Qu'as-tu, Mhand, lui dit-elle, quelle peine t'ai-je faite ?— Ce qui m'attriste, c'est que tu restes là à surveiller un paquet d'épines pendant que les hommes et les femmes du douar sont à la noce, en train de manger et de boire ! »  Là-dessus, la vieille se leva et s'en fut, elle aussi, prendre sa part du festin, laissant le lévrier pour surveiller le hérisson jusqu'à son retour. Le lévrier, accroupi devant le hérisson, l'écoutait parler : « Dieu t'a frappé, toi aussi, de sa malédiction, misérable. Tes frères se rassasient d'os et de couscous pendant que tu es là à me garder ! Me prends-tu pour une saucisse de l'Aïd-el-Kebir ? Vois donc ce que tu surveilles : des épines ! »Et ce disant, il lui montrait ses piquants. Le lévrier se dressa et alla dire à la vieille : « Viens et cherche un autre pour te garder la pelote d'épines ; moi aussi, je veux manger ma part de la fête ! »  Le lévrier berbère est aussi nommé Sloughi. Il est utilisé pour la chasse et la garde au Maroc, en Algérie, en Tunisie et en Libye. Très intelligent, ce chien est aussi très rapide : il a un instinct de chasseur, et beaucoup d'endurance. Cette race a des origines très anciennes ; ses ancêtres sont peut-être les lévriers de l'Égypte antique ! L'allure de ce chien fascinait les chefs berbères qui l'adoptèrent comme compagnon de chasse. On reconnaît le Sloughi à sa tête fine et allongée, à ses oreilles tombantes et à son regard triste. Comme les autres lévriers, il est fidèle et très attaché à son maître. Le hérisson et le chacal furent surpris de découvrir :  Qui surveilla le hérisson, attaché au poteau de la tente ?  Quel est l'autre nom du lévrier berbère ?  Retrouve les caractéristiques du lévrier.  Parmi ces noms, lequel ne désigne pas une race de chien ?    Le hérisson s'était associé avec le chacal pour cultiver. Des nomades s'installèrent un jour sur leurs terres. Quand le chacal et le hérisson s'en furent visiter leurs champs, ils y trouvèrent des chèvres broutant leur grain en herbe.« Amis, dirent-ils aux étrangers, vous nous portez tort ! Si Dieu vous guide dans la bonne voie, décampez de nos champs !— Nous n'en partirons pas ! » répondirent-ils.Et grande fut alors l'inquiétude de nos deux compères.Le chacal dit un jour au hérisson : « Tirons au sort : celui de nous deux qu'il désignera montera sur l'autre et nous irons razzier les chèvres des nomades ! »Le hérisson répondit : « Mets ta confiance en Dieu ! » Et ils tirèrent à la courte paille.Le sort désigna le hérisson qui fut ainsi choisi comme monture. Le chacal lui jeta la selle sur le dos, mais ne sut comment s'y prendre pour monter car elle arrivait jusqu'à terre.Le hérisson l'interpella : « Qu'as-tu à vouloir monter sur moi, lui dit-il, je suis si petit, si court. C'est sur toi que la selle ira : tu es grand et long !— Si c'est là ton désir, mets-la-moi. »La selle était à la taille du chacal, le hérisson mit le pied dans l'étrier et s'écria : « Je sais me servir de l'éperon ! »Et prenant la bride en main, le hérisson monté sur le chacal s'en fut chasser les chèvres de leurs champs.  Levant la tête, les nomades virent le hérisson à califourchon sur le chacal. Ils appelèrent les lévriers qui les prirent en chasse.Le chacal, effrayé, dit au hérisson : « Oncle Mhand ! Je t'en prie, lâche la bride, que je me sauve plus vite ; je sens les lévriers sur moi ! »Le hérisson, serrant plus fortement la bride, lui répondit : « Tranquillise-toi ; cette journée ne se passera pas sans toi ! »Ils allaient ainsi quand ils atteignirent une rivière ; le chacal la franchit mais le hérisson tomba sur place. Il alla alors se cacher sous une bouse de vache, tandis que le chacal disparaissait au loin.Pendant ce temps, les gens du douar célébraient un mariage. Les femmes qui étaient allées chercher du combustible trouvèrent l'oncle Mhand caché sous une bouse. Une vieille le ramassa : « Ô notre ennemi, lui dit-elle, c'est Dieu qui t'a fait prendre ! »  Elle le porta aux gens du douar.« Nous sommes occupés, lui dirent-ils ; il n'y a que toi pour le garder ! »Elle lui passa un collier et l'attacha au poteau de la tente, puis alla s'asseoir devant lui.

      "  Un chat et une souris vivaient ensemble dans un grenier en toute amitié. La souris, raisonnable et économe, songeait à faire des réserves pour l'hiver bien qu'on fût encore en été. Un jour, elle trouva un bon morceau de lard, et dit au chat :« Voilà des provisions pour la mauvaise saison ! Mais où pourrait-on cacher ce lard pour être sûr qu'on ne nous le vole ? Pas ici dans le grenier, car nous serions tentés de le manger avant l'hiver.— On peut le mettre sous l'autel de l'église », proposa le chat. Et le lard fut caché là. Mais, le minou, très gourmand, ne cessait de penser au morceau de lard et décida de retourner à l'église pour en prendre un petit morceau. Pour ne pas éveiller les soupçons de la souris, il inventa une histoire.« Ma cousine qui vit dans le grenier à blé vient d'avoir un chaton. Je suis son parrain et, demain, j'irai à l'église pour son baptême.— Profites-en bien, lui répondit la souris. S'il reste des miettes, pense à m'en rapporter ! »Le lendemain, le chat se rendit à l'église, sortit le morceau de lard de sa cachette et en mangea un morceau. Il s'installa ensuite au soleil pour une longue sieste. Le soir, il rentra au grenier.  « Regarde, dit la souris, j'ai tout rangé pendant que tu étais parti. Tu t'es bien amusé au baptême de ton filleul ?— Oui, répondit le chat, mais je n'ai rien pu te rapporter.— Tant pis, dit la souris un peu déçue. Comment s'appelle le chaton ?— Il s'appelle…, il s'appelle…, hésita le chat, … “Le-Bord”.— Drôle de nom », dit la souris. Quelques jours plus tard, le chat dit à la souris :« Ma cousine qui vit dans la cave vient d'avoir un chaton. Demain, je dois me rendre à son baptême.— Profites-en bien, lui répondit la souris. S'il reste des miettes, pense à m'en rapporter ! » Le chat retourna à l'église et cette fois mangea la moitié du morceau de lard. Il rentra le soir au grenier. « Regarde, dit la souris, j'ai tout rangé pendant que tu étais parti. Tu t'es bien amusé au baptême de ton filleul ?— Oui, répondit le chat, mais je n'ai rien pu te rapporter.— Tant pis, dit la souris encore déçue. Comment s'appelle le chaton ?— Il s'appelle “La-Moitié”, répondit le chat.— Drôle de nom », dit la souris. Le chat se sentait quand même coupable d'avoir mangé la moitié du morceau de lard, mais la tentation était trop forte. Quelques jours plus tard, il dit :« Ma tante qui vit au moulin vient d'avoir un chaton. Je dois me rendre demain à son baptême.— Profites-en bien, lui dit la souris. S'il reste des miettes, pense à m'en rapporter ! »Le chat courut à l'église et mangea le reste du morceau de lard. Il rentra le soir au grenier.« Regarde, dit la souris, j'ai tout rangé pendant que tu étais parti. Tu t'es bien amusé au baptême de ton filleul ?— Oui, répondit le chat, mais je n'ai rien pu te rapporter.— Tant pis, dit la souris, encore une fois déçue. Comment s'appelle le chaton ?— “Tout-Entier”, répondit le chat.— Drôle de nom », dit la souris. L'hiver arriva et la souris dit au chat : « Allons à l'église chercher le morceau de lard. » Le chat l'accompagna sans rien dire. Bien sûr, elle ne trouva pas le morceau de lard. Elle fondit en larmes : « On nous a volé notre lard ! »Le chat, mal à l'aise regardait ailleurs. La souris comprit alors que le lard n'avait pas été volé, mais que c'était le chat qui l'avait mangé. « Ah, j'ai compris ! s'écria-t-elle. C'est toi qui as tout mangé ! Menteur, voleur, méchant, égoïste ! »Elle l'accabla de reproches, tant et si bien qu'exaspéré, le chat se jeta sur elle et la mangea !  L'hiver, les animaux sauvages doivent faire face au froid et au manque de nourriture.Chaque espèce a une ou plusieurs solutions pour s'adapter à ces conditions difficiles :  l'hibernation : dormir tout l'hiver. la migration : se déplacer dans les régions chaudes. la mue : changer de pelage pour se protéger du froid. les provisions : manger les réserves de nourriture accumulées pendant les beaux jours.    Certains animaux comme la marmotte, le hérisson, la chauve souris ou la tortue dorment tout l'hiver !Mais comment font-ils ? La marmotteAu cours de l'été, la marmotte se constitue des réserves de graisse en mangeant beaucoup.Lorsque le froid arrive, elle s'installe avec d'autres marmottes dans un terrier et passe l'hiver au chaud, plongée dans un profond sommeil (d'où l'expression « dormir comme une marmotte » !).Pendant son hibernation, la marmotte utilise petit à petit ses réserves. À son réveil, au printemps, elle a beaucoup maigri !  Ce sont surtout les oiseaux qui se déplacent vers les pays chauds. Chaque automne, ils migrent vers le Sud et ne reviennent qu'au printemps.L'arrivée des hirondelles, de retour d'Afrique, est souvent considérée comme le début des beaux jours.  Le renard, l'hermine, le lièvre ou encore le chamois font partie des animaux qui changent de pelage.Pour affronter l'hiver, leur poil s'épaissit et peut parfois changer de couleur.Ainsi, le lièvre et l'hermine deviennent blancs ce qui leur permet de se dissimuler dans la neige !  La mue s'observe également chez les animaux domestiques, comme le chien ou le chat.L'hiver, leur fourrure devient plus fournie et les aide à résister au froid.  Pour résister à l'hiver, certains animaux font des provisions.C'est le cas, par exemple, de l'écureuil, du castor, de l'abeille, mais aussi de la fourmi (comme dans la fable de Jean de La Fontaine !). L'écureuilDans la forêt, l'écureuil collecte des noix, des noisettes, des glands, des châtaignes, etc.À l'approche du froid, il mange une partie de ses provisions et cache ce qu'il lui reste. Il peut ainsi stocker jusqu'à 125 kg de nourriture qu'il répartit dans différents endroits.Mais gare au trou de mémoire : il lui arrive parfois d'oublier certaines de ses cachettes !  Dans l'histoire, le chat est ami avec :  Le chat et la souris décident de cacher le lard :  Combien le chat prétend-il avoir de filleuls ?    Un chat et une souris vivaient ensemble dans un grenier en toute amitié. La souris, raisonnable et économe, songeait à faire des réserves pour l'hiver bien qu'on fût encore en été. Un jour, elle trouva un bon morceau de lard, et dit au chat :« Voilà des provisions pour la mauvaise saison ! Mais où pourrait-on cacher ce lard pour être sûr qu'on ne nous le vole ?

      "  Un jeune homme partit un jour de chez lui parcourir le vaste monde afin d'apprendre la vraie vie. Avant qu'il s'en aille, sa mère l'avertit : « Ne prends pas, mon fils, des chemins interdits ! Si tu vois un sac noué, ne le dénoue pas ! Et si tu te trouves en danger, pense à moi ! »Le fils promit de se souvenir de toutes ces recommandations, mais à peine fut-il sorti de la yourte qu'il oublia les conseils maternels. Il voyagea un jour, puis un autre, et il arriva à un chemin où deux os croisés gisaient sur le sol. On ne s'engage pas sur de tels chemins ! Mais le jeune homme n'eut pas envie de faire demi-tour. « J'ai tant de force dans mes deux bras que je n'ai rien à craindre », se dit-il. Il prit donc le chemin interdit et vit soudain devant lui un sac fermé par trois nœuds. « Que peut-il bien contenir ? » se demanda-t-il alors. Curieux, il dénoua les trois nœuds. À cet instant précis jaillit du sac un choulame, un monstre hirsute, pourvu de tentacules, avec une bouche énorme et de grandes dents aiguisées.« Je te remercie de m'avoir délivré ! cria le choulame. »  — Comment t'es-tu retrouvé dans ce sac ? demanda le jeune homme.— J'emportais le bétail du village, répondit le choulame, et les habitants m'ont attrapé avec un lasso. Maintenant que je suis libre, je vais pouvoir me venger. Mais je vais d'abord te manger afin de reprendre des forces !— Est-ce ainsi que tu me témoignes ta reconnaissance ? se lamenta le jeune homme.— Nous autres, les choulames, ignorons ce qu'est la gratitude, rétorqua le monstre. Nous ne connaissons que la faim et la vengeance.— Oh, maman ! Si seulement je t'avais écoutée ! » se dit tout bas le jeune homme.Soudain, comme s'il l'avait appelée, sa mère apparut.Celle-ci s'inclina profondément devant le monstre et dit : « Il est bien clair, noble sire, que vous avez tout à fait le droit de manger mon fils qui vient de vous délivrer. Mais je ne peux pas croire qu'un être aussi grand que vous ait pu entrer dans ce sac… — Tu ne me crois pas ? Alors, regarde bien ! » dit le choulame. Et il sauta dans le sac. Seule sa tête dépassait à présent.« Non, je ne peux pas vous croire. Je vois toujours votre tête », répondit la femme. Le choulame entra la tête dans le sac et, aussitôt, la mère le referma et fit trois nœuds.Le monstre tenta de se libérer, mais en vain.« Tu vois, mon fils, si je ne veillais pas sur toi et si je n'avais pas entendu ton appel, tu serais déjà mort. Pourquoi ne m'as-tu pas écoutée ? »Et le jeune homme de promettre à sa mère de toujours suivre ses recommandations. Les monstres sont des créatures effrayantes, laides, puissantes et dotées d'une grande force physique qui sèment la terreur. De nombreux personnages sont considérés comme des montres ! En voici deux exemples. Le loup-garou est un homme qui, à chaque nouvelle pleine lune et pendant trois jours, se transforme en loup. Il est rusé, féroce et dévore plusieurs personnes en une nuit ! Le seul moyen de le tuer est d'utiliser un fusil à balles d'argent bénites. On devient loup-garou comme on devient vampire, en se faisant mordre. Le vampire est une sorte de mort-vivant au teint très pâle qui ne supporte pas la lumière du jour. C'est pourquoi il ne sort qu'à la nuit pour enfoncer ses longues dents dans le cou de ses victimes dont il suce le sang. Le seul moyen de s'en débarrasser : lui enfoncer un pieu dans le cœur ! On peut aussi l'éloigner un moment à l'aide de gousses d'ail ! Mais la mode est aujourd'hui aux monstres gentils, comme Shrek ! L'histoire se déroule dans un pays où l'on vit dans des yourtes. Il s'agit :  Quelle est la caractéristique physique du choulame ?  Parmi ces créatures, lesquelles sont des monstres ?  Par quoi le vampire est-il indisposé ?  Parmi ces monstres, lesquels sont gentils ?    Un jeune homme partit un jour de chez lui parcourir le vaste monde afin d'apprendre la vraie vie. Avant qu'il s'en aille, sa mère l'avertit : « Ne prends pas, mon fils, des chemins interdits ! Si tu vois un sac noué, ne le dénoue pas !

      "  Il était une fois une jeune fille très belle qui s'appelait Hina. Toutes les fées du ciel s'étaient penchées sur son berceau et l'avaient dotée de toutes les qualités : la grâce, la beauté, l'intelligence, la gentillesse. Jamais l'île de Raiatea n'avait connu de reine qui rassemblât autant de qualités.À vingt ans, son cœur n'était pas encore pris, malgré la cour assidue que lui faisaient de nombreux prétendants. Un jour vint pourtant où Hina rencontra le jeune homme qui fit battre son cœur. Elle se fiança sans attendre et annonça la date prochaine de son mariage. En gage d'amour, le fiancé, très épris, lui offrit le cadeau le plus extraordinaire qui n'avait d'égal que les sentiments très purs qu'il lui portait. En découvrant son présent, Hina fut émerveillée. Ni tout l'or de son palais, ni les diamants de sa couronne, ni la splendeur de ses maisons, n'égalaient une telle merveille. De toute la Polynésie, nul pêcheur n'avait jamais imaginé que des perles d'une telle taille, d'une telle perfection pussent exister. Noires, elles étincelaient de mille éclats au cou de la reine, qui jura ne jamais plus se séparer de ce collier que tout l'or du monde n'aurait pu lui arracher. Bien qu'elle en mourût d'envie, Hina, en accord avec son fiancé, décida cependant de ne porter ce collier qu'à partir du jour où leur mariage serait célébré. En attendant, ce collier inestimable serait gardé par des hommes en armes, qui le veilleraient jour et nuit.  Un jour, alors que Hina donnait audience à ses sujets, elle refusa la requête d'un homme, comme cela arrivait lorsque la demande ne lui paraissait pas justifiée. Or, cet homme n'était autre que Hiro, le roi des voleurs. Après avoir été un prétendant éconduit de la jeune reine, Hiro subissait ici un second affront, qu'il ne pût supporter. Se sentant humilié, sa jalousie se transforma rapidement en haine, et Hiro résolut de se venger en s'attaquant à ce que la reine avait de plus cher : son collier de perles. Maître en matière de vols, après avoir déjoué tous les pièges et trompé la surveillance des gardes armés, il parvint par mille ruses à s'emparer du précieux bijou. Tenant sa vengeance en main, et avant même que l'alerte ne fût donnée, Hiro gagnait déjà l'île voisine de Huahine, en pirogue. Sur Raiatea, dès que le vol fut découvert et annoncé à la reine, Hina s'effondra, terrassée par une tristesse infinie. Avec le vol de son collier, c'est une partie de son cœur qu'on venait de lui prendre… et le voleur le savait !  Aussitôt, elle devina qui se cachait derrière ce méfait. Il n'y avait sur terre qu'une seule personne aussi audacieuse et capable de braver la surveillance de la garde royale. C'était bien sûr le terrible Hiro, le roi des voleurs. Sans plus tarder, Hina prit les recherches en mains et décida de lancer aux trousses du malfaiteur le plus impressionnant de ses molosses, une bête dont la force et le flair extraordinaires n'avaient d'égal que son imposante stature. Immédiatement, le superbe animal se dirigea vers le bord de l'eau, pointant déjà le museau en direction de Huahine.Sur cette île, Hiro se croyait à l'abri. Dès son arrivée, il avait dissimulé son prestigieux butin sous une pierre d'un poids impressionnant. « À cet endroit, pensa-t-il, nul ne saura jamais débusquer mon butin. Il n'existe personne sur terre qui soit aussi malin que Hiro, le roi des voleurs ! » Mais déjà s'approchait des rives de Huahine le molosse de la reine… La truffe grosse comme une noix de coco au vent, son travail apporta très rapidement ses fruits. Fuyant dans la montagne où se tenait son repère, Hiro était loin de se douter d'une conclusion aussi rapide… Le molosse s'arrêta à l'endroit même où Hiro avait dissimulé le précieux collier et, comme pour marquer le lieu précis où se cachait le trésor, il posa sa lourde patte sur la pierre. Une fois la pierre soulevée, Hina reprit son collier et épousa, comme il se doit, son fiancé bien aimé… Depuis ce jour, on peut voir, sur l'île de Huahine, l'empreinte d'une patte d'un animal de taille impressionnante gravée dans cette roche bien connue.  La Polynésie est une collectivité d'outre-mer de la France. Proche de l'Australie, ses cinq archipels sont situés dans l'Océan Pacifique.La Polynésie française compte au total 118 îles. La plus grande et la plus peuplée est Tahiti dont la capitale est Papeete.  Les vahinés sont les femmes tahitiennes. Vêtues de costumes en feuilles de pandanus, elles ont des fleurs dans les cheveux ou en collier autour du cou.Paul Gauguin, un célèbre peintre français qui a vécu à Tahiti, a consacré plusieurs tableaux à ces femmes des îles.

Ni tout l'or de son palais, ni les diamants de sa couronne, ni la splendeur de ses maisons, n'égalaient une telle merveille. De toute la Polynésie, nul pêcheur n'avait jamais imaginé que des perles d'une telle taille, d'une telle perfection pussent exister. Noires, elles étincelaient de mille éclats au cou de la reine, qui jura ne jamais plus se séparer de ce collier que tout l'or du monde n'aurait pu lui arracher. Bien qu'elle en mourût d'envie, Hina, en accord avec son fiancé, décida cependant de ne porter ce collier qu'à partir du jour où leur mariage serait célébré. En attendant, ce collier inestimable serait gardé par des hommes en armes, qui le veilleraient jour et nuit.  Un jour, alors que Hina donnait audience à ses sujets, elle refusa la requête d'un homme, comme cela arrivait lorsque la demande ne lui paraissait pas justifiée. Or, cet homme n'était autre que Hiro, le roi des voleurs. Après avoir été un prétendant éconduit de la jeune reine, Hiro subissait ici un second affront, qu'il ne pût supporter. Se sentant humilié, sa jalousie se transforma rapidement en haine, et Hiro résolut de se venger en s'attaquant à ce que la reine avait de plus cher : son collier de perles. Maître en matière de vols, après avoir déjoué tous les pièges et trompé la surveillance des gardes armés, il parvint par mille ruses à s'emparer du précieux bijou. Tenant sa vengeance en main, et avant même que l'alerte ne fût donnée, Hiro gagnait déjà l'île voisine de Huahine, en pirogue. Sur Raiatea, dès que le vol fut découvert et annoncé à la reine, Hina s'effondra, terrassée par une tristesse infinie. Avec le vol de son collier, c'est une partie de son cœur qu'on venait de lui prendre… et le voleur le savait !  Aussitôt, elle devina qui se cachait derrière ce méfait. Il n'y avait sur terre qu'une seule personne aussi audacieuse et capable de braver la surveillance de la garde royale. C'était bien sûr le terrible Hiro, le roi des voleurs. Sans plus tarder, Hina prit les recherches en mains et décida de lancer aux trousses du malfaiteur le plus impressionnant de ses molosses, une bête dont la force et le flair extraordinaires n'avaient d'égal que son imposante stature. Immédiatement, le superbe animal se dirigea vers le bord de l'eau, pointant déjà le museau en direction de Huahine.Sur cette île, Hiro se croyait à l'abri. Dès son arrivée, il avait dissimulé son prestigieux butin sous une pierre d'un poids impressionnant. « À cet endroit, pensa-t-il, nul ne saura jamais débusquer mon butin. Il n'existe personne sur terre qui soit aussi malin que Hiro, le roi des voleurs ! » Mais déjà s'approchait des rives de Huahine le molosse de la reine… La truffe grosse comme une noix de coco au vent, son travail apporta très rapidement ses fruits. Fuyant dans la montagne où se tenait son repère, Hiro était loin de se douter d'une conclusion aussi rapide… Le molosse s'arrêta à l'endroit même où Hiro avait dissimulé le précieux collier et, comme pour marquer le lieu précis où se cachait le trésor, il posa sa lourde patte sur la pierre. Une fois la pierre soulevée, Hina reprit son collier et épousa, comme il se doit, son fiancé bien aimé… Depuis ce jour, on peut voir, sur l'île de Huahine, l'empreinte d'une patte d'un animal de taille impressionnante gravée dans cette roche bien connue. \n",

      "  La famille Meng planta un jour une courge le long du mur de son jardin. La floraison fut magnifique et d'une fleur naquit un fruit exceptionnellement gros. Lorsqu'il arriva à maturité, d'un joli jaune d'or, la famille Meng décida de le cueillir. Mais en coupant le fruit, quelle ne fut pas la surprise des Meng de trouver en son cœur une adorable petite fille. Ils décidèrent de l'élever et la baptisèrent du nom de Djang.Les Meng vivaient sous le règne de l'empereur Shihuang, célèbre pour son injustice et sa cruauté. Craignant les Huns qui ne lui laissaient pas de répit et las de leurs invasions incessantes, l'empereur décida de construire un mur le long de la frontière nord de la Chine. Hélas ! les architectes n'étaient guère brillants et à peine avait-on terminé une partie du mur qu'une autre s'écroulait. Les années passaient et le mur n'était toujours pas terminé.Un jour, un sage du royaume vint trouver l'empereur et après s'être incliné respectueusement devant lui, il dit : « Sire, on ne peut construire un mur devant s'étendre sur dix mille lieues de longueur sauf si dans chaque bloc d'une lieue on enferme un homme. L'esprit de l'homme veillera alors sur ce bloc et le mur deviendra indestructible. »L'empereur, qui ne se souciait guère de son peuple, trouva l'idée excellente et décida de la mettre en œuvre immédiatement. Dans chaque région, chaque ville, chaque maison, ce fut l'horreur. Des hommes, des jeunes filles, des garçonnets furent saisis et emmurés vivants. Un autre sage du royaume vint trouver l'empereur et après s'être incliné respectueusement devant lui, il dit : « Sire, votre façon d'utiliser le peuple pour édifier votre mur terrifie le pays tout entier. Il se pourrait qu'il se révolte avant même que le mur ne soit terminé. Mais j'ai peut-être la solution. Un homme nommé Wan demeure non loin du palais. Or, vous n'êtes pas sans savoir que Wan signifie « dix mille ». Si vous prenez cet homme, il suffira à lui seul pour les dix mille lieues puisque Wan — dix mille — est son nom. »L'empereur se réjouit de cette sage parole et ordonna d'aller chercher ce Wan et de le conduire au mur. Prévenu par des amis, le jeune homme prit la fuite. Après avoir couru fort longtemps, il finit par se réfugier dans un jardin où les grandes feuilles d'un bananier paraissaient une cachette idéale. Or, ce jardin n'était autre que celui des Meng. Un soir, alors que la lune était pleine, la belle Djang, devenue une superbe jeune femme, descendit dans le jardin. Wan l'aperçut et aussitôt, il en tomba éperdument amoureux. Il descendit de sa cachette et lui demanda de devenir sa femme. Djang accepta et ils se marièrent dès le lendemain.Ils étaient en train de célébrer joyeusement leurs noces lorsque les soldats de l'empereur firent irruption dans le jardin et s'emparèrent de Wan qu'ils emmenèrent près du mur. Restée seule, Djang Meng était profondément malheureuse. Même si son union avait été de très courte durée, elle pensait à son époux avec nostalgie et sentait au fond de son cœur un amour sincère, véritable et immense.Désespérée, elle décida de partir à la recherche du corps de son mari. Elle affronta les éléments : la pluie, la neige, les brûlures du soleil. Elle traversa les plaines et les montagnes, les fleuves et les lacs et parvint au prix de grandes souffrances et de fatigues au pied du mur. Devant un édifice aussi immense, elle se demandait comment retrouver les restes de son bien-aimé. Découragée, elle s'assit sur une pierre et se mit à pleurer. Le mur, ému par tant de chagrin, s'écroula, laissant apparaître les os de Wan. L'empereur ne fut pas long à apprendre l'histoire de la femme qui avait cherché son époux par monts et par vaux ainsi que l'effrondrement de son mur. Intrigué, il vint en personne voir Djang, et éperdu d'admiration devant sa beauté, il lui demanda de devenir impératrice.Djang savait qu'elle ne pouvait résister à la volonté de l'empereur. Elle posa diverses conditions pour cette union : une fête des morts de quarante-neuf jours devait être célébrée à la mémoire de son époux ; l'empereur et tous les sujets de la cour devaient prendre part aux funérailles, une terrasse devait être construite sur les rives du fleuve, car Djang souhaitait pouvoir offrir des sacrifices aux morts en souvenir de son époux défunt. L'empereur accéda à toutes ses demandes tant il était désireux qu'elle devienne son épouse.Lorsque la terrasse fut prête, Djang y monta et, à la stupéfaction de tous, maudit à haute voix l'empereur Shihuang d'avoir été si cruel et si injuste. L'empereur contint sa colère et ne dit rien. Les sujets qui entendaient ces paroles étaient sidérés, mais au fond d'eux ils approuvaient les propos de la jeune femme. Lorsqu'elle eut terminé sa tirade, Djang plongea du haut de la terrasse dans le fleuve. L'empereur entra alors dans une terrible colère, ordonnant à ses soldats de repêcher son corps et de le couper en petits morceaux. Les soldats s'exécutèrent immédiatement mais tous les morceaux se transformèrent en poissons d'or et c'est à travers eux que l'âme de la fidèle Djang continue à vivre pour toujours.  La civilisation chinoise est très ancienne ; en effet, depuis 3 500 ans, les dynasties successives ont développé un fonctionnement politique et administratif élaboré. Xia aurait été la première dynastie chinoise (— 2 205 avant J.-C.)  ; la dynastie Qin, celle de notre histoire, a régné à partir de — 221 avant J.-C., et la dernière dynastie ayant régné avant l'avènement de la République en 1912 est celle des Qing. Shihuang, l'empereur autoritaire de ce conte, a donc réellement existé et régné en Chine sous le nom de Qin Shi Huang. Roi et fondateur de la dynastie Qin, il unifia les langues et l'écriture, les poids et les mesures et est à l'origine de la Grande Muraille. Mais c'était un souverain cruel et le pays, avec lui, replongea dans la guerre civile jusqu'à l'arrivée de la dynastie Han. La famille impériale vivait dans un somptueux palais. L'empereur avait un rôle de chef ; il s'entourait de sa première épouse, l'impératrice, de ses autres épouses et concubines vivant dans son harem, et de ses enfants légitimes, princes et princesses.Le titre d'empereur se transmettait de père en fils au sein de chaque dynastie : il s'agissait donc d'un titre héréditaire. À quel titre accède la jeune Djang en épousant le cruel et injuste Shihuang ?  En quoi se transforment les cendres de Djang ?  De quelle dynastie Shi Huang est-il le fondateur ?  Où vivent les épouses de l'empereur ?  Comment s'appelle le célèbre monument chinois ?    La famille Meng planta un jour une courge le long du mur de son jardin. La floraison fut magnifique et d'une fleur naquit un fruit exceptionnellement gros. Lorsqu'il arriva à maturité, d'un joli jaune d'or, la famille Meng décida de le cueillir.

      "  Un homme et sa femme avaient pour leur cœur, un fils, pour leurs bras, le travail, pour leur corps, une petite cabane et une natte pour dormir, pour l'estomac, un peu de nourriture, et au cou pas le moindre petit coquillage. Celui qui avait des coquillages avait tout. Quand il voulait quelque chose, il pouvait tout avoir en échange de coquillages.  Un jour que le garçon jouait, il sentit un parfum extraordinaire. Il en suivit l'arôme. Il courut jusqu'à l'autre bout du village. Là étaient assis des hommes qui mangeaient la nourriture d'où provenait ce délicieux parfum. Celui qui mangeait le plus était l'homme assis au milieu. Il engloutissait sans s'arrêter, et était si gros que son ventre donnait l'impression qu'il allait éclater.Le garçon s'approcha et lui demanda : « Qui es-tu, pour manger des choses qui sentent si bon ? »L'homme tourna la tête et cria d'une voix telle que le garçon eut l'impression d'être plus petit que la plus petite des fourmis : « Comment se fait-il que tu ne saches pas à qui tu t'adresses ? Ce que je porte au cou, tu ne le reconnais pas ? » Il montra avec son doigt gras son collier de coquillages. Il y en avait des grands et des petits, des blancs, des roses, des jaunes, et de toutes les couleurs. « Tu ne sais pas que celui qui possède autant de coquillages est le chef de l'île ? »L'homme se leva, les coquillages tintèrent, et le garçon les admira.« Toi, qui es-tu ? demanda le chef. Tu les voudrais, hein ! mes beaux coquillages ? Ils sont beaux, dis ? Dis qu'ils sont beaux ! Réponds donc ! » Et il enleva l'un de ses colliers qu'il fit danser et tinter sous les yeux du garçon. Il riait. Il riait beaucoup, très fort. Le garçon lui dit : « Ils sont beaux. Ils sont très, très beaux. Moi aussi j'aurai beaucoup de beaux coquillages comme ceux-là et beaucoup de nourriture qui sente très bon. Moi aussi je serai chef. »Le chef, en grande colère, brisa un morceau de coquillage, qu'il jeta aux pieds du gamin :« Va-t'en, tant que je domine encore ma colère. Quand tes colliers seront plus grands que ceux que je porte au cou, reviens me voir. Nous compterons. Celui qui aura le plus de coquillages sera le chef de l'île. »Il rit beaucoup. Tous les hommes rirent avec lui. Le garçon ramassa le morceau de coquillage et s'en alla, très énervé par ce que lui avait fait le chef.  D'abord il voulut jeter le morceau de coquillage, pour ne plus avoir en tête le seigneur de l'île, mais finalement il l'échangea contre un pépin d'orange. Il le planta, puis se coucha pour dormir, car son ventre était vide et ses jambes n'avaient plus de force. Quand il se réveilla, l'arbre était déjà très haut et, quand il se réveilla le jour suivant, ses branches touchaient le ciel. Le garçon sauta, ses mains saisirent les branches, et il monta tout en haut, sur les plus hautes branches de l'arbre.   Au-dessus de lui se balançait une maisonnette. Le garçon, poussé par la curiosité, y entra et vit une femme à l'intérieur.« Fais vite demi-tour et sauve-toi, tu ne sais pas encore quel danger il y a ici, ce qui y est bon et ce qui y est mauvais. Tourne-toi, saute et fuis, pour être loin d'ici. Si mon mari te voit, il fera en sorte que tu meures. C'est un esprit !— Je viens tout juste de grimper jusqu'en haut, pourquoi est-ce que je redescendrais, dit le garçon. Ses yeux regardaient la femme. Ton mari ne m'intéresse pas et ne me fait pas peur !— Mais tu es venu jusqu'à lui. Cache-toi dans le coin, » dit la femme, et elle jeta une natte sur lui. L'esprit arriva et flaira.« Femme, ça sent l'homme ici ! Qui est-ce, femme ? qui donc est ici ?— Quel homme ? » dit la femme, et sa voix était dure comme le bois de fer. « Un enfant est arrivé d'en bas, il est dans le coin, sous la natte. » L'esprit  ne souffla mot , mangea et but avec sa femme. Ils donnèrent au garçon une écuelle de bois sur laquelle était un couvercle fait d'une grande feuille. Quand le garçon souleva la feuille, l'écuelle se remplit de nourriture. Il en prit et mangea, en reprit et remangea, en reprit encore et remangea encore, en donna à l'esprit et à sa femme, et l'écuelle était toujours pleine de nourriture. Quand il en eut assez et qu'il fut rassasié, il recouvrit l'écuelle avec la feuille. Alors l'esprit déposa sur la table quelques bouts de tiges de bambou.  Le garçon les secoua, et des coquillages tombèrent. Il en tomba longtemps, il en tombait toujours, et il y en avait beaucoup. L'esprit et le garçon dirent : « Un, deux, trois, quatre , et ainsi de suite, jusqu'à ce que la force quitte mains et tête, mais ils comptaient toujours. »Puis ils voulurent ranger les coquillages dans les tiges. Il y avait tant de coquillages que ni l'un ni l'autre n'avait plus la force de compter.Déjà le soleil était parti se coucher derrière la forêt, et il faisait noir quand ils remirent enfin le dernier coquillage dans les tiges de bambou.Ensuite le garçon les emporta, ainsi qu'une hache et l'écuelle de bois, et il sortit de la maison par les branches de l'oranger. Il descendit de branche en branche, puis encore d'une branche à l'autre, jusqu'à ce qu'il n'en resta plus que cinq à descendre, puis il n'y en eut plus et il arriva à terre.Il entra dans la cabane de ses parents et déposa sur la table l'écuelle de bois. « Soulevez le couvercle de feuille, et mange, papa, mange la nourriture, maman ! C'est une écuelle que j'ai rapportée de la maison dans le ciel. Elle se balance de gauche à droite, ici et là, ici et là, comme un héron sur ses longs pieds. » L'homme et la femme mangèrent, et ce qu'ils mangeaient était bon pour la langue et pour l'estomac. Ils mangèrent beaucoup, et après chaque bouchée, ils disaient : « Une, deux, trois, et ainsi de suite, jusqu'à ce que la force quitte leurs mains, mais aussi la faim leur estomac, et pourtant ils comptaient toujours. » Puis ils replacèrent la feuille sur l'écuelle de bois et attendirent, car le garçon s'en était allé au moment où ils avaient commencé à manger. Le garçon était parti chercher le chef. Lorsqu'il arriva à sa demeure, le chef se leva, ses coquillages tintinnabulèrent, et le garçon considéra l'homme qui le regardait de toute sa hauteur. Il lui dit :« Je suis venu, comme tu le voulais.— Je te vois, et je m'amuse à l'idée de ce que tu vas me dire, dit le chef.— Celui qui aura le plus de coquillages sera le chef de l'île. Ce sont tes paroles, que je suis venu te rapporter, répondit le garçon.— Oui, celui qui aura le plus de coquillages, dit le chef, et l'orgueil faisait sonner ses coquillages.— Celui de nous deux qui a le plus de coquillages, dis-le à mes oreilles, demanda le garçon.— Va-t'en, tandis que je domine encore ma colère, dit le chef, mais avant, tes petits éclats de coquillages, je te les compterai sur les doigts.— Faisons d'abord le compte de tes coquillages, pas celui des miens. Et nous ferons la différence, et les doigts n'y suffiront peut-être pas. » Ils comptèrent. Le chef avait beaucoup de coquillages, cependant ils arrivèrent à les compter tous. Mais, quand le garçon éparpilla les siens, la bouche du chef s'ouvrit tout grand, comme une grande huître, et resta ouverte. Le chef et le garçon dirent :« Un, deux, trois, quatre, et ainsi de suite, jusqu'à ce que la force quitte mains et tête, mais ils comptaient toujours. » Ensuite, ils n'eurent plus assez de force pour dénombrer tous les coquillages. La bouche du chef ne riait plus, ses colliers ne tintinnabulaient plus à son cou, et sa bouche ne se refermait plus. Il alla s'asseoir chez lui, derrière le four. C'est le garçon qui devint chef.  Les mollusques sont de petits animaux à corps mou vivant sur terre ou dans l'eau. Certains, comme l'escargot, la moule ou l'huître vivent à l'abri dans une coquille. Lorsque la coquille est abandonnée par son habitant, elle devient un coquillage. Le bernard-l'ermite est un crustacé qui aime se réfugier dans les coquilles vides. Les coquillages peuvent prendre différentes formes : cône, spirale, toupie… et même en cœur !Depuis très longtemps, l'Homme les collectionne et les utilise comme parure. Percés, puis enfilés comme une perle, les petits coquillages forment de jolis colliers. Le coquillage est certainement le plus vieux bijou du monde. Au Maroc, les archéologues ont retrouvé un collier datant de 80 000 ans !  Tradition polynésienneLorsqu'une personne quitte son île, sa famille et ses amis lui offre un collier de coquillages pour lui souhaiter bonne chance et bon voyage. Que faut-il faire pour devenir le chef du village ?  Alors que le garçon joue, il sent :  Le garçon échange son morceau de coquillage contre un pépin :  Pour faire tomber les coquillages, le garçon secoue :  Quel crustacé se loge dans les coquilles abandonnées ?  La coquille est l'enveloppe extérieure d'un mollusque.  Lequel de ces animaux est un mollusque ?    Un homme et sa femme avaient pour leur cœur, un fils, pour leurs bras, le travail, pour leur corps, une petite cabane et une natte pour dormir, pour l'estomac, un peu de nourriture, et au cou pas le moindre petit coquillage. Celui qui avait des coquillages avait tout. Quand il voulait quelque chose, il pouvait tout avoir en échange de coquillages.  Un jour que le garçon jouait, il sentit un parfum extraordinaire. Il en suivit l'arôme. Il courut jusqu'à l'autre bout du village. Là étaient assis des hommes qui mangeaient la nourriture d'où provenait ce délicieux parfum. Celui qui mangeait le plus était l'homme assis au milieu. Il engloutissait sans s'arrêter, et était si gros que son ventre donnait l'impression qu'il allait éclater.Le garçon s'approcha et lui demanda : « Qui es-tu, pour manger des choses qui sentent si bon ? »L'homme tourna la tête et cria d'une voix telle que le garçon eut l'impression d'être plus petit que la plus petite des fourmis : « Comment se fait-il que tu ne saches pas à qui tu t'adresses ? Ce que je porte au cou, tu ne le reconnais pas ? » Il montra avec son doigt gras son collier de coquillages. Il y en avait des grands et des petits, des blancs, des roses, des jaunes, et de toutes les couleurs. « Tu ne sais pas que celui qui possède autant de coquillages est le chef de l'île ? »L'homme se leva, les coquillages tintèrent, et le garçon les admira.« Toi, qui es-tu ? demanda le chef. Tu les voudrais, hein ! mes beaux coquillages ? Ils sont beaux, dis ? Dis qu'ils sont beaux ! Réponds donc ! » Et il enleva l'un de ses colliers qu'il fit danser et tinter sous les yeux du garçon. Il riait. Il riait beaucoup, très fort. Le garçon lui dit : « Ils sont beaux. Ils sont très, très beaux. Moi aussi j'aurai beaucoup de beaux coquillages comme ceux-là et beaucoup de nourriture qui sente très bon. Moi aussi je serai chef. »Le chef, en grande colère, brisa un morceau de coquillage, qu'il jeta aux pieds du gamin :« Va-t'en, tant que je domine encore ma colère. Quand tes colliers seront plus grands que ceux que je porte au cou, reviens me voir. Nous compterons. Celui qui aura le plus de coquillages sera le chef de l'île. »Il rit beaucoup. Tous les hommes rirent avec lui. Le garçon ramassa le morceau de coquillage et s'en alla, très énervé par ce que lui avait fait le chef.  D'abord il voulut jeter le morceau de coquillage, pour ne plus avoir en tête le seigneur de l'île, mais finalement il l'échangea contre un pépin d'orange. Il le planta, puis se coucha pour dormir, car son ventre était vide et ses jambes n'avaient plus de force. Quand il se réveilla, l'arbre était déjà très haut et, quand il se réveilla le jour suivant, ses branches touchaient le ciel. Le garçon sauta, ses mains saisirent les branches, et il monta tout en haut, sur les plus hautes branches de l'arbre.   Au-dessus de lui se balançait une maisonnette. Le garçon, poussé par la curiosité, y entra et vit une femme à l'intérieur.« Fais vite demi-tour et sauve-toi, tu ne sais pas encore quel danger il y a ici, ce qui y est bon et ce qui y est mauvais. Tourne-toi, saute et fuis, pour être loin d'ici. Si mon mari te voit, il fera en sorte que tu meures. C'est un esprit !— Je viens tout juste de grimper jusqu'en haut, pourquoi est-ce que je redescendrais, dit le garçon. Ses yeux regardaient la femme. Ton mari ne m'intéresse pas et ne me fait pas peur !— Mais tu es venu jusqu'à lui. Cache-toi dans le coin, » dit la femme, et elle jeta une natte sur lui. L'esprit arriva et flaira.« Femme, ça sent l'homme ici ! Qui est-ce, femme ? qui donc est ici ?— Quel homme ? » dit la femme, et sa voix était dure comme le bois de fer. « Un enfant est arrivé d'en bas, il est dans le coin, sous la natte. » L'esprit  ne souffla mot , mangea et but avec sa femme. Ils donnèrent au garçon une écuelle de bois sur laquelle était un couvercle fait d'une grande feuille. Quand le garçon souleva la feuille, l'écuelle se remplit de nourriture. Il en prit et mangea, en reprit et remangea, en reprit encore et remangea encore, en donna à l'esprit et à sa femme, et l'écuelle était toujours pleine de nourriture. Quand il en eut assez et qu'il fut rassasié, il recouvrit l'écuelle avec la feuille. Alors l'esprit déposa sur la table quelques bouts de tiges de bambou.  Le garçon les secoua, et des coquillages tombèrent. Il en tomba longtemps, il en tombait toujours, et il y en avait beaucoup. L'esprit et le garçon dirent : « Un, deux, trois, quatre , et ainsi de suite, jusqu'à ce que la force quitte mains et tête, mais ils comptaient toujours. »Puis ils voulurent ranger les coquillages dans les tiges. Il y avait tant de coquillages que ni l'un ni l'autre n'avait plus la force de compter.Déjà le soleil était parti se coucher derrière la forêt, et il faisait noir quand ils remirent enfin le dernier coquillage dans les tiges de bambou.Ensuite le garçon les emporta, ainsi qu'une hache et l'écuelle de bois, et il sortit de la maison par les branches de l'oranger. Il descendit de branche en branche, puis encore d'une branche à l'autre, jusqu'à ce qu'il n'en resta plus que cinq à descendre, puis il n'y en eut plus et il arriva à terre.Il entra dans la cabane de ses parents et déposa sur la table l'écuelle de bois. « Soulevez le couvercle de feuille, et mange, papa, mange la nourriture, maman ! C'est une écuelle que j'ai rapportée de la maison dans le ciel. Elle se balance de gauche à droite, ici et là, ici et là, comme un héron sur ses longs pieds. » L'homme et la femme mangèrent, et ce qu'ils mangeaient était bon pour la langue et pour l'estomac. Ils mangèrent beaucoup, et après chaque bouchée, ils disaient : « Une, deux, trois, et ainsi de suite, jusqu'à ce que la force quitte leurs mains, mais aussi la faim leur estomac, et pourtant ils comptaient toujours. » Puis ils replacèrent la feuille sur l'écuelle de bois et attendirent, car le garçon s'en était allé au moment où ils avaient commencé à manger. Le garçon était parti chercher le chef. Lorsqu'il arriva à sa demeure, le chef se leva, ses coquillages tintinnabulèrent, et le garçon considéra l'homme qui le regardait de toute sa hauteur. Il lui dit :« Je suis venu, comme tu le voulais.— Je te vois, et je m'amuse à l'idée de ce que tu vas me dire, dit le chef.— Celui qui aura le plus de coquillages sera le chef de l'île. Ce sont tes paroles, que je suis venu te rapporter, répondit le garçon.— Oui, celui qui aura le plus de coquillages, dit le chef, et l'orgueil faisait sonner ses coquillages.— Celui de nous deux qui a le plus de coquillages, dis-le à mes oreilles, demanda le garçon.— Va-t'en, tandis que je domine encore ma colère, dit le chef, mais avant, tes petits éclats de coquillages, je te les compterai sur les doigts.— Faisons d'abord le compte de tes coquillages, pas celui des miens. Et nous ferons la différence, et les doigts n'y suffiront peut-être pas. » Ils comptèrent. Le chef avait beaucoup de coquillages, cependant ils arrivèrent à les compter tous. Mais, quand le garçon éparpilla les siens, la bouche du chef s'ouvrit tout grand, comme une grande huître, et resta ouverte. Le chef et le garçon dirent :« Un, deux, trois, quatre, et ainsi de suite, jusqu'à ce que la force quitte mains et tête, mais ils comptaient toujours. » Ensuite, ils n'eurent plus assez de force pour dénombrer tous les coquillages. La bouche du chef ne riait plus, ses colliers ne tintinnabulaient plus à son cou, et sa bouche ne se refermait plus. Il alla s'asseoir chez lui, derrière le four. C'est le garçon qui devint chef. \n",

      "  Un homme pêche au bord de la rivière. Soudain, alors qu'il relève la tête, attentif au moindre animal susceptible de passer dans les environs, il voit se dresser à l'horizon la silhouette d'un homme immense. Un géant.L'homme est très effrayé. « Il va me tuer, pense-t-il. Comment faire pour lui échapper ? Je pourrais peut-être faire semblant d'être mort, raide gelé. » Et le voilà qui s'allonge par terre, feignant la mort. Au moment où le géant s'approche, l'homme retient sa respiration. Le géant se penche sur le corps pour entendre si l'homme respire. Pas un souffle. Pour s'assurer que l'homme est bien mort, il l'empoigne et le secoue dans tous les sens. « Il ne bouge pas du tout, il est bien mort », pense le géant. Il attache son fardeau avec une lanière de cuir et le jette sur son dos. L'homme contracte tous ses muscles pour avoir l'air gelé. Il fait de grands efforts pour rester bien raide et retenir sa respiration le plus longtemps possible. Ainsi, il a vraiment l'air d'être mort de froid. Au bout d'un moment, le géant, son fardeau sur le dos, traverse une région plantée de nombreux petits saules rabougris. L'homme, qui entrouvre les yeux de temps en temps, a une idée en apercevant les arbustes. « Si je m'agrippe aux saules, le géant se fatiguera et finira par me laisser sur place », se dit-il.Le voilà qui s'accroche aux branches. À chaque fois que le géant, sentant sa marche ralentie, tire, l'homme lâche la branche ; et le géant trébuche. Après avoir failli tomber plusieurs fois, le géant s'arrête pour se reposer. Il se demande pourquoi il a tant de difficultés à progresser, lui qui d'habitude fait de grandes enjambées. Pris d'un doute, il tend l'oreille pour savoir si l'homme est vivant. Rien, pas un souffle. L'homme retient sa respiration du mieux qu'il peut. Le géant se remet en marche. L'homme, à nouveau, s'agrippe de toutes ses forces aux saules et les lâche à chaque fois que le géant tire. Le géant trébuche encore et encore et finit par s'épuiser. Harassé par des heures de marche difficile, le géant arrive enfin à sa grande demeure. Il range l'homme debout près de l'entrée. Puis, exténué, il se couche sur la plate-forme qui lui sert de lit. Sa femme, géante elle aussi, voit la viande fraîche rangée dans l'entrée et va chercher du combustible pour raviver les flammes de la lampe à huile. Le pauvre homme ouvre discrètement les yeux pour voir ce qui se passe. Du coin de l'œil, il aperçoit la femme qui s'active. Il comprend qu'elle prépare le repas et que le repas ; c'est lui !Les deux grands enfants du géant qui jouent à côté de l'homme le surprennent et s'écrient d'une même voix : « Père, notre dîner est tellement frais que ses yeux viennent de s'ouvrir ! » Vite, l'homme ferme les yeux et se fige. Le géant le regarde et répond : « Mais non, il est mort et bien mort. »L'homme est vraiment effrayé et se demande comment il va pouvoir s'en sortir. Il ouvre à nouveau les yeux, le plus discrètement possible et, sans bouger la tête, cherche un moyen de s'échapper. Il aperçoit, sur le côté, la grande hache du géant.« Elle est tout près, se dit-il. Si seulement je pouvais l'atteindre. » Tout doucement, il avance la main en tâtonnant. Les deux enfants le voient et s'écrient une nouvelle fois : « Père, notre dîner est tellement frais que sa main frémit encore ! »Vite, l'homme remet sa main en place et se fige. Le géant, déjà couché sur la plate-forme, jette un coup d'œil et répond : « Mais non, il est mort et bien mort. Qu'on ne me dérange plus maintenant, allez jouer dehors ! La marche a été longue et difficile et je dois me reposer ! » Le géant, enfin seul et tranquille, s'endort. L'homme patiente, terrorisé, jusqu'au moment où il entend enfin les ronflements du géant. Il se saisit alors de la hache et tue le géant endormi. Il passe la tête par l'entrée et, regardant à droite et à gauche, aperçoit la femme qui s'affaire au loin.Ni une ni deux, le voilà qui se met à courir le plus vite possible. Les enfants du géant voient la scène et interpellent leur mère en criant : « Mère, notre dîner est si frais que ses jambes continuent à courir ! » La géante se retourne et voit le repas s'enfuir. Elle arrête aussitôt sa tâche et part à sa poursuite en hurlant. Grâce à ses grandes jambes, elle gagne rapidement du terrain.L'homme la sent sur ses talons mais ne peut accélérer. « Que faire ? se demande-t-il, affolé. Je ne peux pas aller plus vite et seul, même avec cette hache, je ne ferai pas le poids face à une géante en furie. Si je donne de grands coups de hache à cet endroit, le sol se fendra peut-être et engloutira la géante. »Le voilà qui frappe le sol de toutes ses forces avec sa hache. Le sol se fend alors et une rivière en jaillit. L'homme saute sur la rive opposée et attend. La grande femme arrive bientôt. Mais la rivière est devenue si large et le courant est si fort que la géante doit s'arrêter : « Comment l'as-tu traversée ? »« En la buvant tout entière. » Alors la femme commence à boire, à boire jusqu'à ce que la rivière ne soit plus qu'un mince cours d'eau. L'homme lui dit : « Il en reste, finis-la ! » Alors la femme se remet à boire, à boire, et plus elle boit, plus elle gonfle. Alors qu'elle est déjà énorme, il lui dit encore : « Il en reste, finis-la ! » Au moment où elle finit la rivière, elle est tellement énorme et sa peau tellement tendue par l'eau absorbée qu'elle explose, projetant dans l'air des milliers de fines gouttelettes d'eau. C'est ainsi que le brouillard a été créé. L'homme reste sur place longtemps, car il y a tellement de brouillard qu'il ne sait plus dans quelle direction aller. Enfin, le vent se lève et dissipe peu à peu le brouillard de la grande femme. L'homme peut rentrer chez lui.Voilà ce que l'on raconte à propos du géant et de l'homme.  Dans la mythologie, les géants sont les premiers habitants de la terre.Ce sont des créatures immensément puissantes et de taille énorme. Ils ont des pouvoirs divins qu'ils ont volés aux Dieux, mais ils sont quand même mortels. Les géants de la première génération sont les enfants d'Ouranos (le Ciel) et de Gaïa (la Terre). Ils attaquèrent les Olympiens et décidèrent d'escalader l'Olympe (domaine exclusivement réservé des Dieux) bordée de larges ravins.Parmi eux, on trouve Damysos, le plus rapide des géants, Hippolyte, tué par Hermès alors qu'il portait un casque le rendant invisible, Mimas, enseveli par Héphaïstos sous une masse de fer en fusion et Gration, abattu par les flèches d'Artémis, déesse de la chasse.Les géants de la seconde génération n'ont pas de liens de parenté et ne sont pas forcément effrayants. Ils n'ont en commun avec leurs aînés que la force et la taille. Talos, gardien de la Crète, Orion réputé pour sa beauté et Géryon, géant à trois têtes, sont les plus connus. Dans l'histoire, que fait l'homme pour échapper au géant ?  À qui les géants volent-ils leurs pouvoirs divins ?  Qui sont les parents des géants de la première génération ?  Qu'est ce que l'Olympe ?  Quel géant à l'appétit extraordinaire est le fils de Gargantua ?    Un homme pêche au bord de la rivière. Soudain, alors qu'il relève la tête, attentif au moindre animal susceptible de passer dans les environs, il voit se dresser à l'horizon la silhouette d'un homme immense.

      "  Il était une fois un pauvre fermier et sa femme qui travaillaient très dur sur leur lopin de terre. Le sol était tellement sec que leurs outils se cassaient souvent et qu'à chaque coup, un nuage de poussière s'élevait de la terre. Ils gagnaient donc juste de quoi vivre. Rien de superflu chez José et Anina ; malgré tout, c'était des gens très gentils et heureux de vivre.Un jour, Anina reçut la visite d'un voisin qui lui dit qu'à une journée de marche de chez eux, un riche fermier ne pouvait trouver suffisamment de travailleurs pour l'aider à la récolte. Elle proposa à son mari : « Pourquoi n'irions-nous pas aider ce fermier ? Ici, nous mourons presque de faim. Chez lui, nous pourrions gagner assez d'argent pour vivre décemment. » Son mari la regarda, préoccupé, et lui dit sur le ton de la confidence : « Je ne dis pas non, mais ne sais-tu pas que cette région est habitée par le grand génie de la forêt ? C'est un ogre immense, poilu, à la barbe rouge sang et aux yeux de jais qui lancent des éclairs. Il dévore tous les hommes qu'il rencontre et oblige les femmes à travailler pour lui. Le danger n'est écarté que l'après-midi, car c'est à ce moment qu'il dort. Ça ne m'étonne pas que ce fermier ne trouve plus suffisamment de gens pour rentrer la récolte. Tout le monde a peur. Je ne pense pas que ce soit une bonne idée d'aller habiter aussi près d'un tel monstre.— Moi, je n'ai pas peur ! dit Anina, en riant. Je resterai à l'intérieur et je n'irai faire les courses que l'après-midi. Je t'en prie, allons-y. Je pense que c'est la meilleure chose qui puisse nous arriver ! »Fatigué d'entendre sa femme lui dire tous les bénéfices qu'ils pourraient tirer de leur nouvelle situation, José finit par accepter. Ils emballèrent leurs maigres affaires et quittèrent leur misérable chaumière en quête d'une vie meilleure. Après un jour de marche, ils arrivèrent chez le riche fermier. Celui-ci possédait une magnifique ferme située loin de la forêt du génie. En outre, de nombreux hommes faisaient des rondes afin d'empêcher le génie d'entrer. On donna immédiatement du travail à José aux champs et le fermier leur indiqua une maisonnette à l'orée de la forêt, où ils pourraient habiter.« Vous pourrez vivre ici en toute tranquillité, dit le fermier à Anina. Veille toutefois à rester à l'intérieur. Ne sors que l'après-midi, car c'est le moment où le génie de la forêt se repose. Je vous ferai apporter de la nourriture tous les jours par mes hommes afin que vous ne couriez aucun danger. » Et c'est ce qui se passa. Chaque jour, les hommes de la ferme leur apportaient des vivres. José gagnait bien sa vie en travaillant aux champs et ils étaient très heureux. Ils n'avaient pas aperçu le génie de la forêt et Anina en venait à douter de son existence. Le lendemain matin, les deux hommes partirent de bonne heure. Ils s'enfoncèrent dans la forêt. Après de longues recherches, ils découvrirent enfin la cabane du génie. Ils se dissimulèrent derrière quelques buissons. José vit Anina sortir de la cabane et vider un seau d'eau. Elle était donc bien là. Quant au génie, il restait invisible. « Il est peut-être parti chasser », dit José et il se dirigea vers la petite habitation pour aller chercher Anina. Soudain, le génie jaillit de derrière la cabane en poussant un cri assourdissant. Il s'était caché afin de surprendre José. « Ah, je vais me régaler doublement ! s'exclama le génie. Enfin, pas tout à fait : l'un des deux est tout rabougri. »Il saisit les deux hommes de ses mains poilues. José cria, mais le vieux mendiant n'avait pas peur du tout. « Si tu ne nous lâches pas, je te fais mordre par un serpent », dit-il, fâché. Le génie libéra immédiatement les deux hommes et regarda autour de lui. « Je ne vois aucun serpent. Tu me prends pour un imbécile ! maugréa-t-il. Viens ici, que je te mange le premier. Je garde le savoureux jeune homme pour la fin. »Il tendit la main vers le vieil homme, mais au même moment, ce dernier jeta son bâton sur le sol. Le bâton se changea immédiatement en un gros serpent sifflant. Le génie eut très peur et n'osa plus bouger, car rien ne le terrifiait plus que les serpents. Il mit ses grandes mains devant ses yeux. À présent, il ressemblait plus à un enfant effrayé qu'à un redoutable génie de la forêt.« Éloigne ce serpent ! Éloigne cet affreux serpent ! s'écria-t-il avec effroi. — Je ne le ferai que si tu promets de partir d'ici, répondit le vieux mendiant. Tu dois partir au-delà des montagnes et ne plus jamais revenir. Si tu le promets, je changerai à nouveau le serpent en bâton. — D'accord ! D'accord ! Je partirai ! » répondit le génie de la forêt d'une voix tremblante. — D'accord ! D'accord ! Je partirai ! » répondit le génie de la forêt d'une voix tremblante.Le vieux mendiant sourit. « N'oublie pas ! le prévint-il. Si tu reviens importuner ces pauvres gens, je t'enverrai dix de ces serpents. » Il prit le serpent par la queue et celui-ci se changea immédiatement en bâton. Le génie fit rapidement son baluchon tout en pleurnichant. De temps en temps, il jetait un coup d'œil effrayé au vieux mendiant, mais celui-ci se contentait de l'observer calmement. Un peu plus tard, le génie partit en direction des hautes montagnes que le vieil homme lui avait indiquées. Contente et soulagée, Anina tomba dans les bras de son mari. Sans attendre, le mendiant mit le feu à la cabane du génie. « S'il se retourne et voit la fumée, il saura qu'il n'a plus de maison et qu'il ne peut donc plus dormir ici », expliqua-t-il.Heureux, ils se dirigèrent vers leur maison. Le vieil homme resta encore quelques jours chez José et Anina. Mais un beau matin, il partit sans raison aucune et nul ne le revit jamais. José et Anina coulèrent des jours heureux.Depuis le départ du génie, de plus en plus de gens venaient travailler dans cette région du pays. On construisit plus de fermes, des magasins et des écoles. Le fermier offrit à José un meilleur emploi : il devait diriger le travail de tous les nouveaux arrivants. Le fermier le payait bien, car depuis qu'il avait suffisamment de personnes pour cultiver la terre, il gagnait assez d'argent pour payer à ses employés un bon salaire. José et Anina étaient donc très satisfaits et lorsqu'ils eurent un enfant l'année suivante, ils furent au comble du bonheur. Ils vécurent longtemps à l'orée de la forêt. La ferme est une exploitation agricole gérée par un agriculteur. Selon les régions, la ferme peut avoir une activité très différente : la polyculture, qui consiste à cultiver plusieurs types de plantes, l'élevage, la céréaliculture, la viticulture, l'arboriculture, le maraîchage qui consiste à cultiver des fruits et légumes, l'horticulture, etc. Elle est composée de divers bâtiments selon son activité : une écurie, une bergerie, une porcherie, un poulailler, des clapiers et une batterie d'élevage pour les animaux ; une serre pour les plantations ; un pressoir et une cave à vin pour la viticulture.  Pour chaque type d'exploitation, on utilise des machines et outils spécifiques : pour le travail du sol, l'agriculteur se sert par exemple d'un tracteur et d'une moissonneuse ; pour l'élevage, de la machine à traire. Certaines machines ont des noms très « poétiques » : désileuse (appareil permettant de vider les silos, les réserves à grains), endaineur (machine permettant de former des andins, c'est-à-dire des tas de résidus de la récolte qui serviront de compost), cueilleur-épanouilleur de maïs (machine qui permet de cueillir l'épis sans les feuilles qui l'enveloppent), faneuse (machine qui retourne l'herbe pour faire du foin)… Dans l'histoire, comment s'appelle la femme de José ?  À quoi reconnaît-on le génie de la forêt ?  En quoi le bâton du mendiant est-il transformé ?  Dans quoi vivent les lapins à la ferme ?  Comment s'appelle la culture des plantes ?    Il était une fois un pauvre fermier et sa femme qui travaillaient très dur sur leur lopin de terre. Le sol était tellement sec que leurs outils se cassaient souvent et qu'à chaque coup, un nuage de poussière s'élevait de la terre. Ils gagnaient donc juste de quoi vivre. Rien de superflu chez José et Anina ; malgré tout, c'était des gens très gentils et heureux de vivre.Un jour, Anina reçut la visite d'un voisin qui lui dit qu'à une journée de marche de chez eux, un riche fermier ne pouvait trouver suffisamment de travailleurs pour l'aider à la récolte. Elle proposa à son mari : « Pourquoi n'irions-nous pas aider ce fermier ? Ici, nous mourons presque de faim. Chez lui, nous pourrions gagner assez d'argent pour vivre décemment. » Son mari la regarda, préoccupé, et lui dit sur le ton de la confidence : « Je ne dis pas non, mais ne sais-tu pas que cette région est habitée par le grand génie de la forêt ? C'est un ogre immense, poilu, à la barbe rouge sang et aux yeux de jais qui lancent des éclairs. Il dévore tous les hommes qu'il rencontre et oblige les femmes à travailler pour lui. Le danger n'est écarté que l'après-midi, car c'est à ce moment qu'il dort. Ça ne m'étonne pas que ce fermier ne trouve plus suffisamment de gens pour rentrer la récolte. Tout le monde a peur. Je ne pense pas que ce soit une bonne idée d'aller habiter aussi près d'un tel monstre.— Moi, je n'ai pas peur ! dit Anina, en riant. Je resterai à l'intérieur et je n'irai faire les courses que l'après-midi. Je t'en prie, allons-y. Je pense que c'est la meilleure chose qui puisse nous arriver ! »Fatigué d'entendre sa femme lui dire tous les bénéfices qu'ils pourraient tirer de leur nouvelle situation, José finit par accepter. Ils emballèrent leurs maigres affaires et quittèrent leur misérable chaumière en quête d'une vie meilleure. Après un jour de marche, ils arrivèrent chez le riche fermier. Celui-ci possédait une magnifique ferme située loin de la forêt du génie. En outre, de nombreux hommes faisaient des rondes afin d'empêcher le génie d'entrer. On donna immédiatement du travail à José aux champs et le fermier leur indiqua une maisonnette à l'orée de la forêt, où ils pourraient habiter.« Vous pourrez vivre ici en toute tranquillité, dit le fermier à Anina. Veille toutefois à rester à l'intérieur. Ne sors que l'après-midi, car c'est le moment où le génie de la forêt se repose. Je vous ferai apporter de la nourriture tous les jours par mes hommes afin que vous ne couriez aucun danger. » Et c'est ce qui se passa. Chaque jour, les hommes de la ferme leur apportaient des vivres. José gagnait bien sa vie en travaillant aux champs et ils étaient très heureux. Ils n'avaient pas aperçu le génie de la forêt et Anina en venait à douter de son existence. Le lendemain matin, les deux hommes partirent de bonne heure. Ils s'enfoncèrent dans la forêt. Après de longues recherches, ils découvrirent enfin la cabane du génie. Ils se dissimulèrent derrière quelques buissons. José vit Anina sortir de la cabane et vider un seau d'eau. Elle était donc bien là. Quant au génie, il restait invisible. « Il est peut-être parti chasser », dit José et il se dirigea vers la petite habitation pour aller chercher Anina. Soudain, le génie jaillit de derrière la cabane en poussant un cri assourdissant. Il s'était caché afin de surprendre José. « Ah, je vais me régaler doublement ! s'exclama le génie. Enfin, pas tout à fait : l'un des deux est tout rabougri. »Il saisit les deux hommes de ses mains poilues. José cria, mais le vieux mendiant n'avait pas peur du tout. « Si tu ne nous lâches pas, je te fais mordre par un serpent », dit-il, fâché. Le génie libéra immédiatement les deux hommes et regarda autour de lui. « Je ne vois aucun serpent. Tu me prends pour un imbécile ! maugréa-t-il. Viens ici, que je te mange le premier. Je garde le savoureux jeune homme pour la fin. »Il tendit la main vers le vieil homme, mais au même moment, ce dernier jeta son bâton sur le sol. Le bâton se changea immédiatement en un gros serpent sifflant. Le génie eut très peur et n'osa plus bouger, car rien ne le terrifiait plus que les serpents. Il mit ses grandes mains devant ses yeux. À présent, il ressemblait plus à un enfant effrayé qu'à un redoutable génie de la forêt.« Éloigne ce serpent ! Éloigne cet affreux serpent ! s'écria-t-il avec effroi. — Je ne le ferai que si tu promets de partir d'ici, répondit le vieux mendiant. Tu dois partir au-delà des montagnes et ne plus jamais revenir. Si tu le promets, je changerai à nouveau le serpent en bâton. — D'accord ! D'accord ! Je partirai ! » répondit le génie de la forêt d'une voix tremblante. — D'accord ! D'accord ! Je partirai ! » répondit le génie de la forêt d'une voix tremblante.Le vieux mendiant sourit. « N'oublie pas ! le prévint-il. Si tu reviens importuner ces pauvres gens, je t'enverrai dix de ces serpents. » Il prit le serpent par la queue et celui-ci se changea immédiatement en bâton. Le génie fit rapidement son baluchon tout en pleurnichant. De temps en temps, il jetait un coup d'œil effrayé au vieux mendiant, mais celui-ci se contentait de l'observer calmement. Un peu plus tard, le génie partit en direction des hautes montagnes que le vieil homme lui avait indiquées. Contente et soulagée, Anina tomba dans les bras de son mari. Sans attendre, le mendiant mit le feu à la cabane du génie. « S'il se retourne et voit la fumée, il saura qu'il n'a plus de maison et qu'il ne peut donc plus dormir ici », expliqua-t-il.Heureux, ils se dirigèrent vers leur maison. Le vieil homme resta encore quelques jours chez José et Anina. Mais un beau matin, il partit sans raison aucune et nul ne le revit jamais. José et Anina coulèrent des jours heureux.Depuis le départ du génie, de plus en plus de gens venaient travailler dans cette région du pays. On construisit plus de fermes, des magasins et des écoles.

      "  Ils étaient deux, le Grand et le Petit. Les deux frères vivaient chez le roi et se prélassaient dans un coin de sa cour. Le roi avait beaucoup de cabanes et beaucoup de champs de taro, beaucoup de nattes et de récipients de noix de coco, beaucoup de chapelets de beaux coquillages, mais il n'était pas heureux.Le Grand et le Petit travaillaient pour le roi, mais ne possédaient rien, sans doute ne savaient-ils pas épargner. Chez le roi la nourriture circulait beaucoup, mais n'arrivait pas toujours jusqu'à eux, si bien que le Grand, qui avait toujours faim, était malheureux.Les repas du roi étaient préparés par de nombreux villages, le deuxième après le premier, le troisième après le deuxième, et ainsi, toujours et toujours, tour à tour. Quand un village cuisinait pour le roi, le parfum de cuisine trottait sur tout le pays, puis trottait avec des chants, quand les gens portaient la nourriture au roi.Le parfum et les chants frappèrent le nez et les oreilles des deux frères.« Va à leur rencontre, dit le Grand à son frère. Prends la nourriture de leurs mains, et que tes jambes la portent devant le roi. Le roi aura beaucoup de bonnes choses à manger et beaucoup de parfum, et son estomac sera très rempli, alors il te donnera un morceau, ce morceau tu le partageras, et le plus grand morceau de ce morceau tu le donneras à ton grand frère. Car mon estomac réclame à manger de nouveau. »  Le Petit alla et s'assit sur les marches de pierre de la maison du roi. Il attendait qu'arrive la nourriture, pour la partager entre le roi et le Grand.Les gens se demandèrent pourquoi le Petit était assis sur les marches. Le roi ordonna que l'on appelle le Petit.« Pourquoi es-tu assis sur mes marches ? demanda le roi.— Je suis le Petit, et j'ai faim ô mon roi, mais mon frère est le Grand, et il a très grand-faim. J'attends que l'on vienne du village avec ton repas, je t'apporterai la nourriture et je recevrai de toi un morceau pour mon frère. »Le roi dit aux serviteurs : « Donnez-lui une conque. »Ils lui donnèrent une conque, et le roi dit : « Porte-la à ton frère, et débroussaillez notre village. Vos mains travailleront et vos oreilles n'entendront pas crier votre estomac. Va et fais ce que j'ai dit. »Le Petit alla vers son frère, et le village arriva chez le roi avec la nourriture. Le Petit dit au Grand ce qu'avait ordonné le roi.« Débroussailler tout le village avec une seule conque, c'est un grand travail pour deux hommes, dit le Grand. Mais nos mains travailleront quand les gens iront dormir. »  Les gens se couchèrent et dormirent, puis ils se levèrent et sortirent devant leurs cabanes. Ils s'étonnèrent de voir que toutes les broussailles avaient été coupées. Puis ils rirent et ils hochèrent la tête, et ils félicitèrent les frères. Seulement, pas un seul mot ne sortit de la maison du roi.Le deuxième village prépara le repas du roi. Le parfum et les chants frappèrent le nez et les oreilles des deux frères.« Va, et attends pour les rencontrer, dit le Grand au Petit. Porte la nourriture au roi et le roi te donnera un morceau, ce morceau tu le partageras et le plus grand morceau de ce morceau tu le donneras à ton grand frère. Notre estomac crie très fort, car cette nuit nous avons beaucoup travaillé, mais hier il n'a rien mangé, pas plus qu'aujourd'hui. Rappelle au roi que nous avons fait ce qu'il nous a commandé. »Le Petit alla et s'assit sur les marches de pierre de la maison du roi. Le roi apprit que le Petit était encore assis sur les marches. Le roi dit à ses serviteurs : « Donnez au Petit une botte de bambou, afin que les frères bâtissent une maison pour le roi. » Le Petit retourna auprès de son frère, et le deuxième village arriva chez le roi avec son repas. « Bâtir une maison avec une botte de tiges de bambou, c'est un grand travail pour deux hommes, dit le Grand. Mais nos mains travailleront quand les gens iront dormir. »Les gens se levèrent quand ils virent que c'était le jour. Ils admirèrent la nouvelle maison du roi. Puis ils rirent et hochèrent la tête, et prononcèrent des paroles qui réchauffèrent les frères, même si leur ventre pleurait, et si leur tête et leurs jambes voulaient dormir.Mais de l'ancienne maison du roi pas un seul mot ne sortit.  Quand le troisième village prépara le repas du roi, le Petit était déjà assis sur les marches de pierre. Un serviteur du roi vint et lui donna une hache. « Faites un nouveau canoë pour le roi ! » Le Petit et le Grand construisirent un beau et grand canoë. Le soleil se leva, les gens aussi, et ils virent le nouveau canoë devant la maison du roi. Tous les gens du village admiraient tellement le canoë qu'ils n'allèrent même pas manger, ni pêcher du poisson. De leur bouche coulaient de belles paroles, ils ne trouvaient aucun défaut au canoë. Mais de la maison du roi ne sortit aucun mot. De la maison du roi ne vint pas le moindre morceau de nourriture qui eût pu se partager en deux plus petits morceaux. Les gens admiraient le canoë, mais déjà le Grand et le Petit ne les voyaient plus.  Ils étaient partis sur le rivage et construisaient un grand radeau. Le nom des frères courait à travers tout le pays, et les gens de tous les villages appelaient à venir voir le canoë. Les gens accouraient de partout et apportaient des noix de coco pour les frères. Les frères mirent les noix de coco sur le radeau. Ils prirent également des récipients avec de l'eau, car ils partaient en haute mer.  Ils s'enfuirent sur la mer salée, pour qu'elle boive leurs larmes, les larmes salées d'amertume. Ils se plaignaient du roi, qui s'était montré ingrat et égoïste. Il y avait beaucoup de noix de coco sur le radeau, mais cela faisait déjà beaucoup de jours que la mer transportait le radeau. Le Grand avait déjà mangé toutes ses noix de coco, maintenant le Petit donnait ses noix à son frère. Bientôt il n'y eut plus qu'une seule noix sur le radeau. Le Grand gisait sur le radeau, et sa force s'épuisait.Il dit au Petit : « Réjouis ton cœur, frère. Notre radeau ne va voguer plus qu'un jour et une nuit, puis nous aborderons une nouvelle île. Réjouis ton cœur, car tu ne mourras pas dans un village étranger, mais tu mourras là où nous sommes nés. »Il s'allongea sur le radeau, et ses yeux regardèrent le soleil. Puis il s'endormit pour toujours. Le Petit chanta un chant funèbre, et dans sa tête passèrent les chants et les odeurs qu'il avait partagés avec son frère. Puis il cassa la dernière noix, et le radeau, après une journée et une nuit, aborda sur la rive. Le Petit mit pied à terre, mais toutes ses forces avaient quitté sa tête, son corps et ses jambes. Il avait envie de dormir, de dormir longtemps.Le long du rivage un homme et une femme se promenaient. Ils passèrent sur les jambes du Petit. Ils crurent qu'ils marchaient sur un arbre. Ils se penchèrent et virent que ce n'étaient pas deux branches, mais des jambes. Ils dirent : « D'où viens-tu, homme-arbre ? »Le Petit se leva et alla avec eux dans leur cabane. Ils lui donnèrent une natte pour dormir et de la nourriture. Il mangea avec eux, il travailla avec eux. Quand la force revint dans ses bras et dans ses jambes, et quand sa tête fut plus claire, il dit à l'homme et à la femme : « Je veux parcourir votre île et voir de nouvelles choses et un nouveau pays. »L'homme et la femme le laissèrent partir, mais ils lui dirent : « Tu arriveras à un endroit où se dressent deux rochers. Il te faut passer entre eux. Mais les rochers ne restent pas immobiles, ils sautent l'un contre l'autre sans cesse. Seul celui qui a le pied rapide passe entre eux vivant ; celui qui a le pied lent, ils lui écrasent la tête comme une noix. »Le Petit partit et découvrit de nouveaux villages. Puis il arriva devant les rochers. C'étaient de très grands rochers, et ils sautaient l'un vers l'autre en faisant grand bruit. Le Petit passa entre eux, repoussant l'un d'un coup d'épaule et l'autre d'un coup de pied. Puis il les écrasa en petits morceaux, et répandit les cailloux sur le sol : « C'est bien fait pour vous, mauvais rochers qui avez écrasé la tête des gens ! »Il retourna chez l'homme et la femme, mangea avec eux, travailla aux champs avec eux. Une fois l'homme lui dit : « Homme-arbre, viens avec nous pêcher le poisson, il n'y a plus de chair à manger, et les femmes et les enfants ont faim. »Ils se dirigèrent vers le rivage et marchèrent sur la grève, mais dans la mer il y avait beaucoup de requins. Les gens se demandaient comment ils allaient pouvoir pêcher, car ils mouraient de faim. Ils crièrent : « Qui ira dans l'eau pour chasser les requins ?— Moi, dit le Petit. » Il sauta entre les requins, les requins sautèrent sur lui.Le Petit saisit une noix de coco, qui flottait sur l'eau, et en donna des coups à tous les requins, les tuant. De grandes vagues et des tourbillons noyèrent et engloutirent les requins, mais elles emportèrent loin dans la mer le Petit. Les gens, étonnés, l'appelèrent de la berge. Ils renoncèrent à le secourir, car les vagues étaient trop fortes pour leurs canots.Le Petit nageait, nageait de toutes ses forces quand il entendit une voix qui l'appelait du fond de la mer.Soudain il vit le Grand qui lui dit :« Je t'amène des poissons. Accroche-toi à leur queue, ils te mèneront sur la grève. »Ils ramenèrent le Petit jusqu'au rivage, et le Petit aperçut l'homme et la femme, qui se réjouirent de son retour. Ils lui dirent : « Homme-arbre, tu veux rentrer chez toi ?— Oui, dit le Petit. »Ils déposèrent une très grande feuille sur le rivage, et ils dirent : « Mets-toi sur cette feuille. »Le Petit se coucha dessus, et ils le recouvrirent avec une autre très grande feuille. Puis ils découpèrent un morceau du rivage avec la feuille, et ils le placèrent sur l'eau, comme un radeau. La mer emporta le radeau avec le Petit jusqu'à l'île où étaient nés les deux frères. Le roi apprit que le Petit était revenu. Il envoya sa femme se dissimuler entre les cannes à sucre. Lui-même, il grimpa dans le trou par lequel sortait la fumée de la cheminée de sa maison. Le Petit arriva, et il débusqua le roi.« Roi, pourquoi es-tu assis dans le trou que la fumée a sali ?— Je veux que mon corps reçoive un peu de chaleur », dit le roi à voix basse, et tout tremblant.« Moi aussi, je veux recevoir un peu de chaleur dans mon corps. Mais avec ton corps, tu as bouché le trou pour la fumée, et je ne peux pas me réchauffer. Je me souviens combien j'avais faim et plus encore mon frère, quand tu étais roi et que tu nous prenais notre part. Viens avec moi ! »Ils sortirent de la maison, et le Petit poussa le roi devant lui, jusqu'à l'endroit où le roi avait des cannes à sucre. « Pourquoi es-tu assise dans les cannes à sucre ? se moqua le Petit en tirant la reine par sa robe. Je voulais en prendre et en manger. Mais tu es ici, et je ne peux pas. Je me souviens comment c'était quand nous sommes partis avec mon Grand frère sur un radeau et que nous n'avions pas la moindre noix de coco. Et comment mon frère est mort. Viens avec moi ! »Le Petit poussa devant lui la reine et le roi, et le sourire lui tomba des lèvres. Dans sa tête passa une ombre chaude et rouge.Le Petit les força à embarquer sur le radeau, qu'il poussa sur la mer libre. Il leur cria, tandis qu'ils s'éloignaient : « Vos oreilles étaient bouchées pour ne pas entendre nos ventres qui pleuraient de faim. Vos yeux étaient aveugles et ne voyaient pas que de nos yeux coulaient des larmes salées. Allez sur la mer et goûtez combien elle brûle, l'eau salée ! Écoutez comment il chante, le ventre creux ! »Les grandes vagues poussèrent le radeau, qui devint de plus en plus petit. Le Petit le regarda s'éloigner : « Quand vous rencontrerez le Grand, mon frère, qui est mort par là, dites-lui que je suis revenu sur l'île où nous sommes nés, lui et moi. Dites-lui que je suis revenu et que je vous ai envoyés vers lui, pour qu'il vous dise ceci : \"Ne fais rien de ce qui amène les larmes dans les yeux des gens et la colère dans leur cœur !\" »Après, il retourna au village.  Le cocotier fait partie de la famille des palmiers. Il pousse surtout dans les régions tropicales, près de la mer, et peut mesurer jusqu'à 25 mètres ! Ses feuilles, les palmes, sont très grandes. La noix de coco est le fruit du cocotier. De couleur brune, sa coque est très dure et recouverte de longues fibres… on pourrait croire qu'elle a des poils !Blanc, l'intérieur du fruit s'appelle « amande ». C'est cette partie qui est comestible. Le fruit est presque entièrement rempli d'un liquide sucré et rafraichissant : l'eau de coco. Il ne faut pas la confondre avec le lait de coco qu'on obtient en pressant la chair du fruit après l'avoir râpé. Le savais-tu ?Un cocotier peut porter entre 50 et 500 noix de coco !La noix de coco met un an à mûrir complétement !  Sur quel arbre pousse la noix de coco ?  Pourquoi le Grand est-il malheureux ?  Quelles tâches le roi confie-t-il aux deux frères ?  En échange de leur travail, le roi donne à manger aux deux frères.  Comment se montre le roi ?  Sur la nouvelle île, le Petit reçoit :  À la fin de l'histoire, que fait le Petit ?    Ils étaient deux, le Grand et le Petit. Les deux frères vivaient chez le roi et se prélassaient dans un coin de sa cour. Le roi avait beaucoup de cabanes et beaucoup de champs de taro, beaucoup de nattes et de récipients de noix de coco, beaucoup de chapelets de beaux coquillages, mais il n'était pas heureux.Le Grand et le Petit travaillaient pour le roi, mais ne possédaient rien, sans doute ne savaient-ils pas épargner. Chez le roi la nourriture circulait beaucoup, mais n'arrivait pas toujours jusqu'à eux, si bien que le Grand, qui avait toujours faim, était malheureux.Les repas du roi étaient préparés par de nombreux villages, le deuxième après le premier, le troisième après le deuxième, et ainsi, toujours et toujours, tour à tour. Quand un village cuisinait pour le roi, le parfum de cuisine trottait sur tout le pays, puis trottait avec des chants, quand les gens portaient la nourriture au roi.Le parfum et les chants frappèrent le nez et les oreilles des deux frères.« Va à leur rencontre, dit le Grand à son frère. Prends la nourriture de leurs mains, et que tes jambes la portent devant le roi. Le roi aura beaucoup de bonnes choses à manger et beaucoup de parfum, et son estomac sera très rempli, alors il te donnera un morceau, ce morceau tu le partageras, et le plus grand morceau de ce morceau tu le donneras à ton grand frère. Car mon estomac réclame à manger de nouveau. »  Le Petit alla et s'assit sur les marches de pierre de la maison du roi. Il attendait qu'arrive la nourriture, pour la partager entre le roi et le Grand.Les gens se demandèrent pourquoi le Petit était assis sur les marches. Le roi ordonna que l'on appelle le Petit.« Pourquoi es-tu assis sur mes marches ? demanda le roi.— Je suis le Petit, et j'ai faim ô mon roi, mais mon frère est le Grand, et il a très grand-faim. J'attends que l'on vienne du village avec ton repas, je t'apporterai la nourriture et je recevrai de toi un morceau pour mon frère. »Le roi dit aux serviteurs : « Donnez-lui une conque. »Ils lui donnèrent une conque, et le roi dit : « Porte-la à ton frère, et débroussaillez notre village. Vos mains travailleront et vos oreilles n'entendront pas crier votre estomac. Va et fais ce que j'ai dit. »Le Petit alla vers son frère, et le village arriva chez le roi avec la nourriture. Le Petit dit au Grand ce qu'avait ordonné le roi.« Débroussailler tout le village avec une seule conque, c'est un grand travail pour deux hommes, dit le Grand. Mais nos mains travailleront quand les gens iront dormir. »  Les gens se couchèrent et dormirent, puis ils se levèrent et sortirent devant leurs cabanes. Ils s'étonnèrent de voir que toutes les broussailles avaient été coupées. Puis ils rirent et ils hochèrent la tête, et ils félicitèrent les frères. Seulement, pas un seul mot ne sortit de la maison du roi.Le deuxième village prépara le repas du roi. Le parfum et les chants frappèrent le nez et les oreilles des deux frères.« Va, et attends pour les rencontrer, dit le Grand au Petit. Porte la nourriture au roi et le roi te donnera un morceau, ce morceau tu le partageras et le plus grand morceau de ce morceau tu le donneras à ton grand frère. Notre estomac crie très fort, car cette nuit nous avons beaucoup travaillé, mais hier il n'a rien mangé, pas plus qu'aujourd'hui. Rappelle au roi que nous avons fait ce qu'il nous a commandé. »Le Petit alla et s'assit sur les marches de pierre de la maison du roi. Le roi apprit que le Petit était encore assis sur les marches. Le roi dit à ses serviteurs : « Donnez au Petit une botte de bambou, afin que les frères bâtissent une maison pour le roi. » Le Petit retourna auprès de son frère, et le deuxième village arriva chez le roi avec son repas. « Bâtir une maison avec une botte de tiges de bambou, c'est un grand travail pour deux hommes, dit le Grand. Mais nos mains travailleront quand les gens iront dormir. »Les gens se levèrent quand ils virent que c'était le jour. Ils admirèrent la nouvelle maison du roi. Puis ils rirent et hochèrent la tête, et prononcèrent des paroles qui réchauffèrent les frères, même si leur ventre pleurait, et si leur tête et leurs jambes voulaient dormir.Mais de l'ancienne maison du roi pas un seul mot ne sortit.  Quand le troisième village prépara le repas du roi, le Petit était déjà assis sur les marches de pierre. Un serviteur du roi vint et lui donna une hache. « Faites un nouveau canoë pour le roi ! » Le Petit et le Grand construisirent un beau et grand canoë. Le soleil se leva, les gens aussi, et ils virent le nouveau canoë devant la maison du roi. Tous les gens du village admiraient tellement le canoë qu'ils n'allèrent même pas manger, ni pêcher du poisson. De leur bouche coulaient de belles paroles, ils ne trouvaient aucun défaut au canoë. Mais de la maison du roi ne sortit aucun mot. De la maison du roi ne vint pas le moindre morceau de nourriture qui eût pu se partager en deux plus petits morceaux. Les gens admiraient le canoë, mais déjà le Grand et le Petit ne les voyaient plus.  Ils étaient partis sur le rivage et construisaient un grand radeau. Le nom des frères courait à travers tout le pays, et les gens de tous les villages appelaient à venir voir le canoë. Les gens accouraient de partout et apportaient des noix de coco pour les frères. Les frères mirent les noix de coco sur le radeau. Ils prirent également des récipients avec de l'eau, car ils partaient en haute mer.  Ils s'enfuirent sur la mer salée, pour qu'elle boive leurs larmes, les larmes salées d'amertume. Ils se plaignaient du roi, qui s'était montré ingrat et égoïste. Il y avait beaucoup de noix de coco sur le radeau, mais cela faisait déjà beaucoup de jours que la mer transportait le radeau. Le Grand avait déjà mangé toutes ses noix de coco, maintenant le Petit donnait ses noix à son frère. Bientôt il n'y eut plus qu'une seule noix sur le radeau. Le Grand gisait sur le radeau, et sa force s'épuisait.Il dit au Petit : « Réjouis ton cœur, frère. Notre radeau ne va voguer plus qu'un jour et une nuit, puis nous aborderons une nouvelle île. Réjouis ton cœur, car tu ne mourras pas dans un village étranger, mais tu mourras là où nous sommes nés. »Il s'allongea sur le radeau, et ses yeux regardèrent le soleil. Puis il s'endormit pour toujours. Le Petit chanta un chant funèbre, et dans sa tête passèrent les chants et les odeurs qu'il avait partagés avec son frère. Puis il cassa la dernière noix, et le radeau, après une journée et une nuit, aborda sur la rive. Le Petit mit pied à terre, mais toutes ses forces avaient quitté sa tête, son corps et ses jambes. Il avait envie de dormir, de dormir longtemps.Le long du rivage un homme et une femme se promenaient. Ils passèrent sur les jambes du Petit. Ils crurent qu'ils marchaient sur un arbre. Ils se penchèrent et virent que ce n'étaient pas deux branches, mais des jambes. Ils dirent : « D'où viens-tu, homme-arbre ? »Le Petit se leva et alla avec eux dans leur cabane. Ils lui donnèrent une natte pour dormir et de la nourriture. Il mangea avec eux, il travailla avec eux. Quand la force revint dans ses bras et dans ses jambes, et quand sa tête fut plus claire, il dit à l'homme et à la femme : « Je veux parcourir votre île et voir de nouvelles choses et un nouveau pays. »L'homme et la femme le laissèrent partir, mais ils lui dirent : « Tu arriveras à un endroit où se dressent deux rochers. Il te faut passer entre eux. Mais les rochers ne restent pas immobiles, ils sautent l'un contre l'autre sans cesse. Seul celui qui a le pied rapide passe entre eux vivant ; celui qui a le pied lent, ils lui écrasent la tête comme une noix. »Le Petit partit et découvrit de nouveaux villages. Puis il arriva devant les rochers. C'étaient de très grands rochers, et ils sautaient l'un vers l'autre en faisant grand bruit. Le Petit passa entre eux, repoussant l'un d'un coup d'épaule et l'autre d'un coup de pied. Puis il les écrasa en petits morceaux, et répandit les cailloux sur le sol : « C'est bien fait pour vous, mauvais rochers qui avez écrasé la tête des gens ! »Il retourna chez l'homme et la femme, mangea avec eux, travailla aux champs avec eux. Une fois l'homme lui dit : « Homme-arbre, viens avec nous pêcher le poisson, il n'y a plus de chair à manger, et les femmes et les enfants ont faim. »Ils se dirigèrent vers le rivage et marchèrent sur la grève, mais dans la mer il y avait beaucoup de requins. Les gens se demandaient comment ils allaient pouvoir pêcher, car ils mouraient de faim. Ils crièrent : « Qui ira dans l'eau pour chasser les requins ?— Moi, dit le Petit. » Il sauta entre les requins, les requins sautèrent sur lui.Le Petit saisit une noix de coco, qui flottait sur l'eau, et en donna des coups à tous les requins, les tuant. De grandes vagues et des tourbillons noyèrent et engloutirent les requins, mais elles emportèrent loin dans la mer le Petit. Les gens, étonnés, l'appelèrent de la berge. Ils renoncèrent à le secourir, car les vagues étaient trop fortes pour leurs canots.Le Petit nageait, nageait de toutes ses forces quand il entendit une voix qui l'appelait du fond de la mer.Soudain il vit le Grand qui lui dit :« Je t'amène des poissons. Accroche-toi à leur queue, ils te mèneront sur la grève. »Ils ramenèrent le Petit jusqu'au rivage, et le Petit aperçut l'homme et la femme, qui se réjouirent de son retour. Ils lui dirent : « Homme-arbre, tu veux rentrer chez toi ?— Oui, dit le Petit. »Ils déposèrent une très grande feuille sur le rivage, et ils dirent : « Mets-toi sur cette feuille. »Le Petit se coucha dessus, et ils le recouvrirent avec une autre très grande feuille. Puis ils découpèrent un morceau du rivage avec la feuille, et ils le placèrent sur l'eau, comme un radeau. La mer emporta le radeau avec le Petit jusqu'à l'île où étaient nés les deux frères. Le roi apprit que le Petit était revenu. Il envoya sa femme se dissimuler entre les cannes à sucre. Lui-même, il grimpa dans le trou par lequel sortait la fumée de la cheminée de sa maison. Le Petit arriva, et il débusqua le roi.« Roi, pourquoi es-tu assis dans le trou que la fumée a sali ?— Je veux que mon corps reçoive un peu de chaleur », dit le roi à voix basse, et tout tremblant.« Moi aussi, je veux recevoir un peu de chaleur dans mon corps. Mais avec ton corps, tu as bouché le trou pour la fumée, et je ne peux pas me réchauffer. Je me souviens combien j'avais faim et plus encore mon frère, quand tu étais roi et que tu nous prenais notre part. Viens avec moi ! »Ils sortirent de la maison, et le Petit poussa le roi devant lui, jusqu'à l'endroit où le roi avait des cannes à sucre. « Pourquoi es-tu assise dans les cannes à sucre ? se moqua le Petit en tirant la reine par sa robe. Je voulais en prendre et en manger. Mais tu es ici, et je ne peux pas. Je me souviens comment c'était quand nous sommes partis avec mon Grand frère sur un radeau et que nous n'avions pas la moindre noix de coco. Et comment mon frère est mort. Viens avec moi ! »Le Petit poussa devant lui la reine et le roi, et le sourire lui tomba des lèvres. Dans sa tête passa une ombre chaude et rouge.Le Petit les força à embarquer sur le radeau, qu'il poussa sur la mer libre. Il leur cria, tandis qu'ils s'éloignaient : « Vos oreilles étaient bouchées pour ne pas entendre nos ventres qui pleuraient de faim. Vos yeux étaient aveugles et ne voyaient pas que de nos yeux coulaient des larmes salées. Allez sur la mer et goûtez combien elle brûle, l'eau salée ! Écoutez comment il chante, le ventre creux ! »Les grandes vagues poussèrent le radeau, qui devint de plus en plus petit. Le Petit le regarda s'éloigner : « Quand vous rencontrerez le Grand, mon frère, qui est mort par là, dites-lui que je suis revenu sur l'île où nous sommes nés, lui et moi. Dites-lui que je suis revenu et que je vous ai envoyés vers lui, pour qu'il vous dise ceci : \"Ne fais rien de ce qui amène les larmes dans les yeux des gens et la colère dans leur cœur !\" »Après, il retourna au village. \n",

      "Mais les nouvelles se propagent vite et, dans le petit village, l'histoire de la découverte du trésor se répandit comme une traînée de poudre. Un voisin en perdit même le sommeil de jalousie. Il pensait sans cesse au bonheur des vieux et à leur fortune. Persuadé que le petit chien avait un don pour découvrir les trésors enfouis, il se rendit chez ses voisins afin qu'ils lui prêtent leur animal pour quelques jours.« Nous aimons tellement notre chien que nous ne saurions nous séparer de lui, pas même une heure » lui dit le vieillard. Mais l'envieux ne se lassa pas. Chaque jour, il revenait avec la même demande, et comme les deux vieux étaient bons et qu'ils ne pouvaient refuser quoi que ce fût à un homme, ils finirent par lui prêter leur chien.De retour chez lui, le voisin mena l'animal dans son jardin. Aussitôt, il s'arrêta, flaira le sol et se mit à gratter. Le voisin accourut, suivi de sa femme, qui portait une pioche. Ils creusèrent la terre, et trouvèrent un grand tas d'ordures puantes et de vieux os. L'homme fut rempli d'une violente colère. Il leva sa pioche avec rage et tua le petit chien. Le méchant homme courut en geignant chez ses bons voisins, et d'une petite voix leur dit : « Quel malheur ! Votre petit chien est mort brusquement en arrivant dans mon jardin. Personne ne sait comment cela est arrivé. Je n'en suis pas responsable, et je vous en ai porté la nouvelle aussitôt, pour que vous puissiez l'ensevelir. »Avec beaucoup de tristesse, les deux vieux emmenèrent leur petit chien à l'endroit où il avait trouvé le trésor, et l'enterrèrent sous le vieux pin. Ils pleurèrent, car, dorénavant, ils n'avaient plus personne à aimer qu'eux-mêmes.Cependant, une nuit, alors que le vieillard dormait, son chien lui apparut en rêve et lui dit : « Coupe l'arbre sous lequel je suis enseveli, et fais-en un mortier à riz. Cela te consolera. »  Dès son réveil, le vieillard raconta son rêve à sa femme. Celle-ci lui conseilla de suivre les instructions du chien. Il avait toujours été gentil avec eux, et son message ne pouvait être qu'un bon présage. Le vieux coupa l'arbre, et fit de son tronc un grand et beau mortier. Le temps de la récolte du riz était arrivé. Le vieillard prit son nouveau mortier et y entassa les grains. Mais au lieu de grains, il en sortit une quantité de pièces d'or brillantes. Les deux vieux se réjouirent de tout leur cœur.  Mais les nouvelles se propagent vite et, dans le petit village, l'histoire du mortier se répandit comme une traînée de poudre. Le voisin envieux en perdit le sommeil de jalousie. Il pensait sans cesse au bonheur des vieux et à leur fortune. Il retourna chez ses voisins et leur demanda de lui prêter leur mortier à riz. « Nous aimons tellement notre mortier que nous ne saurions nous séparer de lui, pas même une heure », lui dit le vieillard.Mais l'envieux ne se lassa pas. Chaque jour, il revenait avec la même demande, et comme les deux vieux étaient bons et qu'ils ne pouvaient refuser quoi que ce fût à un homme, ils finirent par lui prêter leur mortier. De retour chez lui, le voisin se mit vite à éplucher des grains de riz. Aidé de sa femme, il en amena des ballots entiers, car il comptait bien faire une riche récolte de pièces d'or. Mais, cette fois encore, son avidité fut durement châtiée. Au lieu de pièces d'or, il ne sortit des grains que d'affreuses ordures puantes et de vieux os. L'homme fut rempli d'une violente colère. Il prit un marteau et, avec rage, brisa le mortier en petits morceaux, qu'il brûla.Le méchant homme courut en geignant chez ses voisins et d'une petite voix leur dit : « Quel malheur ! Votre mortier s'est mis à flamber sans raison. Personne ne sait comment cela est arrivé. Je n'en suis pas responsable, et je vous en ai porté la nouvelle aussitôt, pour que vous ne l'attendiez pas en retour. »Les bons vieux furent naturellement très peinés en apprenant ce qui était arrivé. Ils allèrent se coucher avec beaucoup de tristesse dans le cœur. Mais une fois encore, le vieil homme vit son chien en rêve. Celui-ci le consola et lui dit d'aller chez son voisin et de lui prendre les cendres du mortier brûlé, de les emporter sur la grand-route et, lorsque le roi passerait, de grimper sur les cerisiers encore dénudés et d'y répandre les cendres. Au passage du cortège royal, les cerisiers fleuriraient aussitôt, dans toute leur splendeur.  Le matin suivant, le vieillard alla chez son voisin et emporta les cendres de son mortier. Et suivant les conseils du chien, il les mit dans un sac et s'en alla sur la grand-route, là où les cerisiers étaient encore nus, car ce n'était pas la saison où les arbres se parent de leur robe de fleurs multicolores et odorantes.À peine arrivé, il vit venir sur la route le roi et toute sa suite. Il grimpa bien vite sur un cerisier, et au lieu de se jeter face contre terre comme le faisaient tous les sujets en signe de respect, il resta perché sur son arbre. Le roi, lorsqu'il l'aperçut, ordonna à ses soldats de saisir le vieux et de le châtier. Mais le vieillard, sans se laisser intimider, prit les fines cendres de son sac et les répandit sur les arbres des alentours. Aussitôt tout fleurit, et l'air s'emplit d'un parfum enivrant. Le roi en fut si charmé et intrigué qu'il offrit de riches présents au vieillard, et le fit venir dans son château pour l'honorer.  Mais les nouvelles se propagent vite et, dans le petit village, l'histoire des cendres du mortier se répandit comme une traînée de poudre. Le voisin envieux en perdit le sommeil de jalousie. Il pensait sans cesse au bonheur des vieux et à leur fortune. Il ramassa les cendres du mortier qui restaient encore dans la cheminée, et se mit en route pour faire fleurir lui aussi les cerisiers en l'honneur du roi, puisque le vieillard en avait été tellement récompensé.À peine arrivé, il vit venir sur la route le roi et toute sa suite. Il grimpa bien vite sur un cerisier, et au lieu de se jeter face contre terre comme le faisaient tous les sujets en signe de respect, il resta perché sur son arbre. Le roi, lorsqu'il l'aperçut, ordonna à ses soldats de se saisir du voisin envieux afin de le châtier. Celui-ci prit par poignées les fines cendres de son sac et les répandit sur les arbres des alentours. Aussitôt d'affreuses ordures puantes et de vieux os volèrent jusqu'au visage du roi et des hommes de sa suite en salissant leurs vêtements. Les gardes attrapèrent le méchant homme et le rouèrent de coups. Ils le ligotèrent et le jetèrent en prison, où il resta de longues années.Mais les nouvelles se propagent vite et, dans le petit village, l'histoire du voisin envieux se répandit comme une traînée de poudre. Lorsqu'il fut enfin remis en liberté, personne ne voulut avoir affaire à lui, et il mourut piteusement peu de temps après.Quant aux deux vieux, ils n'oublièrent jamais leur cher petit chien. Ils vécurent cependant heureux jusqu'à la fin de leur vie.   Le chien est un mammifère qui appartient à la famille des canidés, tels que le renard, le loup, ou le chacal. Les chiots sont les petits du chien et de la chienne.Il existe des centaines de races de chiens différents dont l'aspect varie beaucoup selon le cas. Mais tous les chiens ont un flair très développé, une truffe humide au bout du museau et des griffes non rétractiles (qui ne se rentrent pas). Particulièrement dociles, ils peuvent être dressés par l'homme.Il est assez facile de comprendre le comportement d'un chien : il aboie lorsqu'il est en colère, baisse les oreilles quand il a peur, et remue la queue s'il est content. Le chien est l'animal domestique le plus fréquemment choisi par l'homme. On dit d'ailleurs de lui qu'il est le meilleur ami de l'homme et son plus fidèle compagnon. En effet, le chien aide les chasseurs, les handicapés, les victimes d'accident (chiens secouristes de montagne), les policiers (chiens policiers), etc.  Dans l'histoire, que trouve le chien en grattant le sol ?  Avec quel outil le voisin se débarrasse-t-il du chien ?  À quel endroit le couple enterre-t-il le chien ?  Dans le rêve du vieillard, que lui conseille le chien ?  Que trouve le voisin à la place de l'argent ?  Grâce aux fleurs et à leur parfum, quelle personne le vieillard arrive-t-il à charmer ?  Qu'offre le roi au vieillard en remerciement ?  Quel est le principal défaut du voisin ?  À quelle famille d'animal le chien appartient-il ?  Quel est le cri du chien ?  Quelle est la principale qualité du chien ?  Mais les nouvelles se propagent vite et, dans le petit village, l'histoire de la découverte du trésor se répandit comme une traînée de poudre. Un voisin en perdit même le sommeil de jalousie. Il pensait sans cesse au bonheur des vieux et à leur fortune.

      "  Minos était le nom du tout-puissant roi de Crète. Les habitants de cette île charmante et ceux des îles voisines le craignaient et n'osaient aller contre ses volontés. Mais un jour, ses deux frères entreprirent de lui ravir le trône. Pour montrer à tous son très grand pouvoir, Minos pria alors Neptune, le dieu des Mers et des Océans, de lui accorder un présent. Exauçant ce vœu, Neptune fit surgir de l'écume et des vagues furieuses un taureau blanc, aussi sauvage que beau. Au comble de sa joie, le roi ne se doutait pas alors qu'il aurait à regretter cette faveur divine… Bien des années auparavant, Minos avait épousé la fille du Soleil, la très belle Pasiphaé. Le couple avait eu plusieurs enfants et rien ne semblait devoir s'opposer au bonheur du roi, de la reine et des jeunes princes et princesses. Mais un jour, par quelque enchantement, la reine Pasiphaé s'éprit du superbe taureau blanc de son époux. Elle ne tarda pas à enfanter un monstre, mi-homme mi-taureau : le Minotaure. Bien sûr, lorsqu'il apprit cette naissance, le roi entra dans une terrible colère et, honteux, il décida de cacher l'enfant. Pour cela, il demanda à son architecte Dédale de construire un curieux palais, dont les salles et les couloirs, en nombre infini, s'entrelaçaient mystérieusement. C'est en ce lieu, appelé labyrinthe, que le Minotaure fut enfermé. Nul ne pouvait s'en échapper.  Le pouvoir de Minos ne cessait de croître. Et bientôt, ce fut le tour des Athéniens de se soumettre à l'autorité de ce roi insatiable et rageur. Minos, qui gardait une grande rancune contre ce peuple, pour un malheur survenu en leur ville, exigea qu'on lui livrât sept jeunes filles et jeunes gens tous les neuf ans. Ces jeunes personnes étaient conduites à l'intérieur du labyrinthe pour y servir de repas au Minotaure. Un nouveau jour arriva où il fallut désigner les quatorze Athéniens qui partiraient en Crète. À la surprise de tous, un jeune homme, nommé Thésée, offrit de partir avec les victimes. Il espérait pouvoir anéantir le monstre qui demandait tant de sacrifices à Athènes. Tous acclamèrent son courage et sa générosité ; tous étaient assurés de son succès… Seul son père, le roi Égée, craignait un malheur. Avant le départ, ce père aimant fit promettre à Thésée de faire hisser des voiles blanches à son retour pour signifier qu'il était sain et sauf. Et son bateau quitta le port…  En Crète, les enfants de Minos et de Pasiphaé avaient grandi. Ariane, l'une des jeunes princesses, était devenue délicate et jolie, curieuse et volontaire. Naturellement, lorsqu'elle apprit l'arrivée des Athéniens, elle se mêla à la foule pour les apercevoir. En voyant passer Thésée, la princesse ne put s'empêcher d'admirer l'allure et le courage du jeune homme. Dès lors, elle mit tout en œuvre pour le sauver. Elle fit venir Dédale et lui demanda un moyen de sortir du labyrinthe. Puis, elle fit venir Thésée. Elle lui assura qu'elle pouvait l'aider. En échange, elle lui fit promettre de l'emmener avec lui. Alors, elle lui donna une pelote de fil. On conduisit les Athéniens jusqu'au labyrinthe. À l'intérieur du palais, Thésée accrocha le fil d'Ariane à une extrémité de la porte puis il le déroula au fur et à mesure qu'il avançait. Il se guidait au son des râles du monstre… Il s'approcha bientôt de la chambre de Minotaure, qu'il trouva endormi. Sans attendre, Thésée leva son épée, transperça le monstre de tous côtés et le cloua au sol. Une fois le combat terminé, le jeune homme reprit la pelote à l'endroit même où il l'avait laissée. Il n'avait qu'à suivre le fil pour revenir sur ses pas et s'échapper du labyrinthe. Suivi des treize autres Athéniens, il alla rejoindre la princesse qui l'avait tant aidé, et tous se précipitèrent à bord du bateau qui s'éloigna aussitôt de la Crète. Thésée et ses compagnons firent escale sur l'île de Naxos. Ariane, épuisée par ses aventures et le voyage en mer, songeait à sa famille, à ses amis, à sa patrie, à tout ce qu'elle avait abandonné pour sauver et suivre Thésée. Elle ne tarda pas à s'endormir… Thésée profita de son sommeil pour délaisser la princesse, et, sans elle, il quitta Naxos et fit route vers Athènes. Mais, dans sa joie et sa précipitation, il oublia de hisser les voiles blanches comme il l'avait promis à son père. Celui-ci guettait chaque jour le retour de son fils. Aussi, fut-il submergé par la douleur lorsqu'il vit approcher le navire aux voiles sombres. Pour lui, c'était le signe de la mort de son enfant. Du haut du rocher où il se trouvait, il se jeta dans la mer, celle qui, depuis, porte son nom. En apprenant la mort de son père, Thésée se souvint de sa promesse et regretta vivement son empressement. Sa tristesse fut immense… Par la suite, il devint roi d'Athènes, un titre qu'il avait bien mérité en raison de son courage et des épreuves qu'il avait traversées. Les expressions dont l'origine renvoie à la mythologie grecque sont très nombreuses.En voici quelques exemples :  Ouvrir la boîte de Pandore. Cette expression signifie « agir de manière irréfléchie en prenant le risque d'en subir les conséquences ». Elle vient du mythe de Pandore, une femme trop curieuse qui ouvrit un vase dont sortirent tous les maux de la Terre. Toucher le pactole.. Dans la mythologie grecque, le Pactole est le fleuve dans lequel Midas, qui transformait en or tout ce qu'il touchait, allait se purifier. Cela signifie « recevoir une grosse somme d'argent ». Un travail de Titan est une tâche colossale à accomplir. L'expression fait référence à la difficulté que le Titan Cronos éprouva pour prendre la place de son père Ouranos. Un cheval de Troie. Cette expression, courant en informatique, désigne un cadeau empoisonné. Elle provient de L'Odyssée d'Homère qui relate les 10 ans de la guerre de Troie opposant les Grecs et les Troyens. Pensant avoir gagné la guerre, les Troyens acceptèrent un cadeau de leurs ennemis : un immense cheval de bois. Une fois la nuit tombée, les Grecs, cachés dans le cheval, sortirent pour envahir la cité Troyenne et prendre l'avantage. Le talon d'Achille est le point faible d'une personne. À sa naissance, la mère d'Achille trempa son fils dans le fleuve Styx, réputé pour rendre invulnérable. Pour le plonger, elle le tint par le talon, seule partie de son corps qui demeura vulnérable.  Nombreux sont les mots attribués à des lieux, des objets, des rues, des sociétés, des organisations qui trouvent leur source dans la mythologie. Par exemple : l'Europe, la fusée Ariane, le programme Apollo, le Titanic, un atlas, les Champs-Élysées, le chaos, une éolienne, olympien, etc. Comment s'appelle le roi de Crète ?  Qu'est-ce qu'un Minotaure ?  L'architecte Dédale a construit :  Pourquoi Thésée entre-t-il dans le labyrinthe ?  Comment Thésée parvient-il à sortir du labyrinthe ?  Quel est le nom du père de Thésée ?  La boîte ouverte par Pandore renfermait :  Une seule partie du corps d'Achille est vulnérable. Laquelle ?    Minos était le nom du tout-puissant roi de Crète. Les habitants de cette île charmante et ceux des îles voisines le craignaient et n'osaient aller contre ses volontés. Mais un jour, ses deux frères entreprirent de lui ravir le trône. Pour montrer à tous son très grand pouvoir, Minos pria alors Neptune, le dieu des Mers et des Océans, de lui accorder un présent. Exauçant ce vœu, Neptune fit surgir de l'écume et des vagues furieuses un taureau blanc, aussi sauvage que beau. Au comble de sa joie, le roi ne se doutait pas alors qu'il aurait à regretter cette faveur divine… Bien des années auparavant, Minos avait épousé la fille du Soleil, la très belle Pasiphaé. Le couple avait eu plusieurs enfants et rien ne semblait devoir s'opposer au bonheur du roi, de la reine et des jeunes princes et princesses. Mais un jour, par quelque enchantement, la reine Pasiphaé s'éprit du superbe taureau blanc de son époux. Elle ne tarda pas à enfanter un monstre, mi-homme mi-taureau : le Minotaure. Bien sûr, lorsqu'il apprit cette naissance, le roi entra dans une terrible colère et, honteux, il décida de cacher l'enfant. Pour cela, il demanda à son architecte Dédale de construire un curieux palais, dont les salles et les couloirs, en nombre infini, s'entrelaçaient mystérieusement. C'est en ce lieu, appelé labyrinthe, que le Minotaure fut enfermé. Nul ne pouvait s'en échapper.  Le pouvoir de Minos ne cessait de croître. Et bientôt, ce fut le tour des Athéniens de se soumettre à l'autorité de ce roi insatiable et rageur. Minos, qui gardait une grande rancune contre ce peuple, pour un malheur survenu en leur ville, exigea qu'on lui livrât sept jeunes filles et jeunes gens tous les neuf ans. Ces jeunes personnes étaient conduites à l'intérieur du labyrinthe pour y servir de repas au Minotaure. Un nouveau jour arriva où il fallut désigner les quatorze Athéniens qui partiraient en Crète. À la surprise de tous, un jeune homme, nommé Thésée, offrit de partir avec les victimes. Il espérait pouvoir anéantir le monstre qui demandait tant de sacrifices à Athènes. Tous acclamèrent son courage et sa générosité ; tous étaient assurés de son succès… Seul son père, le roi Égée, craignait un malheur. Avant le départ, ce père aimant fit promettre à Thésée de faire hisser des voiles blanches à son retour pour signifier qu'il était sain et sauf. Et son bateau quitta le port…  En Crète, les enfants de Minos et de Pasiphaé avaient grandi. Ariane, l'une des jeunes princesses, était devenue délicate et jolie, curieuse et volontaire.

      "  Comme il ne pouvait plus supporter les hommes et leur méchanceté, le plus puissant de tous les sorciers avait décidé de quitter son pays et de se réfugier tout au sommet de la plus haute des hautes montagnes. Aussitôt dit, aussitôt fait… Un grand malheur s'abattit sur la nature ; toutes les fleurs, celles des bois, celles des prairies, celles des collines, celles des bords de mer, celles des berges des rivières et celles des lacs moururent instantanément. Pas une seule ne survécut, ce qui fit fuir tous les animaux, les oiseaux, les papillons et les insectes. Après leur mort, le pays, jadis si beau et si fleuri, devint rapidement un désert, ne laissant aux habitants que leur imagination pour voir des fleurs. Mais les enfants, qui n'avaient jamais connu ces merveilles, ne voulaient pas croire les anciens.  « Vous ne racontez que des histoires » leur disaient-ils. Et ils s'en allaient tristes, dans les étendues grises d'un pays sans fleurs.Parmi tous ces enfants, il en était un qui ne pouvait imaginer que tout eût disparu pour toujours. Lorsque sa mère, lassée de raconter l'ancien temps, se taisait, il réclamait encore et encore d'autres histoires, car il aimait entendre parler de la beauté des fleurs.  Il pensait que, lorsqu'il serait un homme, il partirait à la recherche du grand sorcier et lui demanderait de redonner de la couleur au pays. Les années passèrent.  Un jour, il fut grand. Son amour des fleurs avait grandi avec lui. Il s'en alla donc trouver sa mère et lui dit : « Mère, je vais m'en aller à la recherche du grand sorcier et lui demander de nous rendre les fleurs. » Sa mère le regarda avec des yeux remplis d'effroi. « Mais fils, s'écria-t-elle, tout ce que je t'ai raconté n'était que des histoires ! Il ne faut jamais croire aux histoires. Je te disais ce que ma mère me racontait parce qu'elle l'avait entendu de sa mère, qui le tenait de sa mère. Malheur à toi ! Les fleurs n'ont probablement jamais existé. Tu aurais beau marcher mille ans, jamais tu ne trouverais le sorcier qui vit tout en haut de la plus haute montagne. » Mais le fils ne l'écouta même pas, il prit son baluchon et s'en alla. Les gens du pays, qui le voyaient passer, se moquaient de lui. « Ce garçon est fou ! disaient-ils. Il n'y a que les fous qui croient aux histoires. »Le jeune homme se dirigea vers le nord. Il marcha longtemps, longtemps, longtemps et arriva au pied d'une montagne, si haute que son sommet était invisible.Il tourna autour de la montagne, mais ne vit aucun sentier, seulement de la roche et des cailloux. Il tourna encore et encore. Las de tourner, il se dit : « Il faudra bien que je découvre un chemin. Le sorcier a dû en prendre un pour atteindre le sommet. »  Il inspecta avec attention les rochers, et finit par découvrir une petite marche. En regardant de plus près, il aperçut une autre petite marche et puis encore une autre. Lorsqu'il leva les yeux vers le sommet de la montagne, il aperçut un escalier, et il se mit à grimper sans jamais regarder en bas pour ne pas avoir le vertige. À la fin du premier jour, il s'arrêta sur une terrasse. Le sommet de la montagne n'était pas visible. Il en fut de même le deuxième, puis le troisième, puis le quatrième, puis le cinquième, puis le sixième jour. Il commençait à se décourager quand, au soir du septième jour, il aperçut enfin le sommet. À force de courage et malgré la fatigue accumulée depuis sept jours, il parvint à l'atteindre, juste au moment où le soleil avait complètement disparu et où la nuit recouvrait entièrement le monstre de pierre. Arrivé tout en haut, il devina une source. Il se pencha pour y boire un peu d'eau. Au premier contact sur ses lèvres, toute sa fatigue s'évapora. Il se sentit fort et heureux comme jamais dans sa vie. Tout à coup, derrière lui, il entendit une voix qui lui demanda ce qu'il était venu chercher sur la plus haute des hautes montagnes. « Je suis venu, dit-il, pour rencontrer le grand sorcier et lui demander de nous rendre les fleurs et les insectes. Un pays sans fleurs, sans oiseaux et sans abeilles est triste à mourir. Seule la beauté peut rendre les gens bons, et je suis certain que ceux de mon pays cesseraient d'être méchants si le sorcier leur redonnait les fleurs. » Alors, le jeune homme se sentit soulevé par des mains invisibles. Il fut transporté délicatement vers le pays des fleurs éternelles. Les mains invisibles le déposèrent sur le sol, au milieu d'un tapis de fleurs multicolores.  Le jeune homme ne pouvait en croire ses yeux. Il y en avait tant ! Jamais il n'avait imaginé que les fleurs puissent être aussi belles ! Dans l'air, un délicieux parfum flottait, et les rayons du soleil jouaient sur le sol multicolore. C'était comme si des milliers et des milliers d'arcs-en-ciel dansaient. La joie du jeune homme fut si grande qu'il se mit à pleurer. La voix lui dit de cueillir les fleurs qu'il préférait. Il s'exécuta et en récolta de toutes les couleurs. Quand il en eut les bras chargés, les mains invisibles le reconduisirent doucement au sommet de la montagne.  Alors, la voix lui dit : « Rapporte ces fleurs dans ton pays. Désormais, grâce à ta foi et à ton courage, ton pays ne sera plus jamais sans fleurs. Il y en aura pour toutes les régions. Les vents du nord, de l'est, du sud et de l'ouest leur apporteront la pluie qui sera leur nourriture, et les abeilles vous donneront le miel qu'elles cherchent dans les fleurs. »Le jeune homme remercia et commença aussitôt la descente de la montagne qui, malgré la quantité de fleurs qu'il portait, lui parut bien plus facile que la montée.Quand il revint dans son pays, les habitants, en apercevant les fleurs et en respirant leur parfum, ne voulurent pas croire à leur bonheur. Puis, lorsqu'ils surent qu'ils ne rêvaient pas, ils dirent :« Ah, nous savions bien que les fleurs existaient et que ce n'étaient pas des histoires inventées par nos ancêtres ! »  Leur pays redevint un grand jardin. Sur les collines, dans les vallées, près des rivières, des lacs et de la mer, dans les bois, dans les champs et dans toutes les prairies, les fleurs crûrent et se multiplièrent. Tantôt c'était le vent du nord qui amenait la pluie, tantôt le vent du sud, de l'est ou de l'ouest. Les oiseaux revinrent, ainsi que les papillons et tous les insectes, surtout les abeilles. Désormais, les gens purent manger du miel, et la joie revint sur la terre. Quand les hommes virent leur pays transformé grâce au jeune homme qui avait osé ce que personne n'avait cru possible, ils lui demandèrent d'être leur roi. II accepta et devint un roi bon, courageux et intelligent. « Rappelons-nous, disait-il, que c'est la méchanceté des hommes qui a entraîné la disparition des fleurs de notre pays. »Et comme personne ne voulait recommencer à habiter un désert et à être privé de miel, chacun s'efforça désormais d'être aussi bon que possible pour ne plus jamais fâcher le grand sorcier.  Le mielEn été, les abeilles, attirées par l'odeur des fleurs, s'activent dans le jardin. Il s'agit des butineuses. Avec leur trompe, elles aspirent le liquide fabriqué par les fleurs : le nectar. Puis elles retournent à la ruche. Le nectar avalé par les abeilles devient du miel. En arrivant, les butineuses déposent le miel dans les alvéoles en cire. Elles font ainsi des réserves de nourriture. Le miel peut avoir un goût de lavande, d'acacia, de sapin, etc.On peut fabriquer beaucoup de choses avec le miel : du pain d'épice, du nougat, des bonbons, et même du savon ! Et avec la cire : des bougies !  L'apiculteurL'apiculteur est la personne qui récupère le miel logé dans les rayons de cire de la ruche. Pour éviter les piqûres, il enfume les abeilles (car cela brouille leurs sens) et porte des vêtements blancs, couleur que les abeilles ne voient pas. Quel est le personnage principal de l'histoire ?  Où le plus puissant de tous les sorciers part-il se réfugier ?  Que se passe-t-il lors du départ du sorcier ?  Comment le peuple récompense-t-il le jeune homme pour avoir ramené les fleurs ?  Quelle petite bête n'est pas un insecte ?    Comme il ne pouvait plus supporter les hommes et leur méchanceté, le plus puissant de tous les sorciers avait décidé de quitter son pays et de se réfugier tout au sommet de la plus haute des hautes montagnes. Aussitôt dit, aussitôt fait… Un grand malheur s'abattit sur la nature ; toutes les fleurs, celles des bois, celles des prairies, celles des collines, celles des bords de mer, celles des berges des rivières et celles des lacs moururent instantanément.

      "  Le petit chacal était un animal très rusé mais, malheureusement, il n'en profitait pas seulement pour se défendre, il aimait aussi berner les gens. Hélas ! Si on apprend vite que l'on peut être très rusé, on trouve toujours quelqu'un de plus rusé encore. Et c'est ce qui arriva au petit chacal.Le chacal aimait beaucoup les coquillages et les crabes. Quand il eut mangé tous ceux qui se trouvaient du côté du fleuve où il vivait, il se dit qu'il devait y en avoir beaucoup sur l'autre rive. Mais le fleuve était trop large, et le courant trop fort pour qu'il puisse traverser à la nage. Il y songea longtemps, et, un jour, il alla trouver son camarade le chameau.« Frère chameau, dit-il, je connais un endroit où il y a de fameuses cannes à sucre, je te le montrerai si tu veux m'y porter. — De bon cœur, dit le chameau qui aimait beaucoup les cannes à sucre. Où est-ce ? — Oh ! de l'autre côté de la rivière, dit le petit chacal, mais, si je monte sur ton dos, nous y arriverons facilement. »Le chameau ne demandait pas mieux. Le petit chacal grimpa sur son dos, entre les deux bosses, et le chameau traversa la rivière à la nage. Quand ils furent sur le bord, le petit chacal sauta à terre, indiqua au chameau le champ de cannes à sucre et courut vers la rivière pour chercher des crabes, pendant que le chameau se régalait sans penser à rien.Le petit chacal fut rassasié avant que le chameau eût seulement mâché trois cannes à sucre. Petit père chacal n'avait pas la moindre envie d'attendre que son camarade eût fini et il se mit à courir tout autour du champ en glapissant et en faisant un grand bruit. Les villageois l'entendirent tout de suite.  « Il y a un chacal dans le champ de cannes à sucre, dirent-ils. Il va faire des trous et abîmer toute la récolte, il faut le chasser. » Ils arrivèrent en hâte avec des pierres et des bâtons, et ne virent point de chacal ; rien qu'un grand chameau qui croquait tranquillement les roseaux sucrés. Ils lui jetèrent des pierres, le frappèrent avec leurs bâtons, et le firent sortir à moitié assommé. Quand les villageois furent partis, le petit chacal arriva en dansant, et dit à son compagnon : « Il faut s'en aller, maintenant.— Bien, je te retiens, dit le chameau ; en voilà un camarade ! Quelle idée t'a pris de glapir et de sauter comme cela ?— Oh ! je ne sais pas, dit le chacal. C'est une habitude que j'ai comme ça de chanter après dîner. — Ah ? dit le chameau. Très bien. Rentrons chez nous, maintenant. » Il laissa le chacal grimper sur son dos et entra dans l'eau. Quand il fut à mi-chemin, au beau milieu de la rivière, il s'arrêta et dit : « Chacal ? — Quoi ? dit le petit chacal. — J'ai une drôle d'envie, reprit le chameau. Je crois que je vais me rouler dans l'eau. — Te rouler ? cria le chacal. Ne fais pas ça, frère, tu vas me noyer ! Qu'est-ce qui te donne cette idée ? Pourquoi veux-tu te rouler ? — Oh ! je ne sais pas, répondit le chameau. C'est une habitude que j'ai comme ça de me rouler après dîner ! »Il se roula donc, et le petit chacal tomba dans l'eau et manqua de peu se noyer ! Il eut toutes les peines du monde à gagner la rive. Le chameau, quant à lui, revint tranquillement à la maison, et ne voulut plus jamais lui parler. Dans l'histoire, de quoi raffole le chacal ?  Dans l'histoire, quelle est la nourriture préférée du chameau ?  Combien de bosse a un chameau ?    Le petit chacal était un animal très rusé mais, malheureusement, il n'en profitait pas seulement pour se défendre, il aimait aussi berner les gens. Hélas ! Si on apprend vite que l'on peut être très rusé, on trouve toujours quelqu'un de plus rusé encore. Et c'est ce qui arriva au petit chacal.Le chacal aimait beaucoup les coquillages et les crabes.

Petit père chacal n'avait pas la moindre envie d'attendre que son camarade eût fini et il se mit à courir tout autour du champ en glapissant et en faisant un grand bruit. Les villageois l'entendirent tout de suite.  « Il y a un chacal dans le champ de cannes à sucre, dirent-ils. Il va faire des trous et abîmer toute la récolte, il faut le chasser. » Ils arrivèrent en hâte avec des pierres et des bâtons, et ne virent point de chacal ; rien qu'un grand chameau qui croquait tranquillement les roseaux sucrés. Ils lui jetèrent des pierres, le frappèrent avec leurs bâtons, et le firent sortir à moitié assommé. Quand les villageois furent partis, le petit chacal arriva en dansant, et dit à son compagnon : « Il faut s'en aller, maintenant.— Bien, je te retiens, dit le chameau ; en voilà un camarade ! Quelle idée t'a pris de glapir et de sauter comme cela ?— Oh ! je ne sais pas, dit le chacal. C'est une habitude que j'ai comme ça de chanter après dîner. — Ah ? dit le chameau. Très bien. Rentrons chez nous, maintenant. » Il laissa le chacal grimper sur son dos et entra dans l'eau. Quand il fut à mi-chemin, au beau milieu de la rivière, il s'arrêta et dit : « Chacal ? — Quoi ? dit le petit chacal. — J'ai une drôle d'envie, reprit le chameau. Je crois que je vais me rouler dans l'eau. — Te rouler ? cria le chacal. Ne fais pas ça, frère, tu vas me noyer ! Qu'est-ce qui te donne cette idée ? Pourquoi veux-tu te rouler ? — Oh ! je ne sais pas, répondit le chameau. C'est une habitude que j'ai comme ça de me rouler après dîner ! »Il se roula donc, et le petit chacal tomba dans l'eau et manqua de peu se noyer ! Il eut toutes les peines du monde à gagner la rive. Le chameau, quant à lui, revint tranquillement à la maison, et ne voulut plus jamais lui parler.\n",

      "  Il était une fois une petite fille de village, la plus jolie qu'on eût su voir ; sa mère en était folle, et sa mère-grand plus folle encore. Cette bonne femme lui fit faire un petit chaperon rouge, qui lui seyait si bien que partout on l'appelait le petit Chaperon rouge.Un jour sa mère, ayant cuit et fait des galettes, lui dit : « Va voir comme se porte ta mère-grand, car on m'a dit qu'elle était malade, porte-lui une galette et ce petit pot de beurre. » Le petit Chaperon rouge partit aussitôt pour aller chez sa mère-grand, qui demeurait dans un autre village. En passant dans un bois elle rencontra compère le loup, qui eut bien envie de la manger ; mais il n'osa, à cause de quelques bûcherons qui étaient dans la forêt. Il lui demanda où elle allait ; la pauvre enfant, qui ne savait pas qu'il est dangereux de s'arrêter à écouter un loup, lui dit : « Je vais voir ma mère-grand, et lui porter une galette avec un petit pot de beurre que ma mère lui envoie. »— Demeure-t-elle bien loin ? lui dit le loup.— Oh ! oui, dit le petit Chaperon rouge, c'est par-delà le moulin que vous voyez tout là-bas, à la première maison du village.— Hé bien, dit le loup, je veux l'aller voir aussi ; je m'y en vais par ce chemin ici, et toi par ce chemin-là, et nous verrons qui plus tôt y sera. »  Le loup se mit à courir de toute sa force par le chemin qui était le plus court, et la petite fille s'en alla par le chemin le plus long, s'amusant à cueillir des noisettes, à courir après des papillons, et à faire des bouquets des petites fleurs qu'elle rencontrait.Le loup ne fut pas longtemps à arriver à la maison de la mère-grand ; il heurte : Toc, toc. « Qui est là ?— C'est votre fille le petit Chaperon rouge (dit le loup, en contrefaisant sa voix) qui vous apporte une galette et un petit pot de beurre que ma mère vous envoie. »La bonne mère-grand, qui était dans son lit à cause qu'elle se trouvait un peu mal, lui cria : « Tire la chevillette, la bobinette cherra. »Le loup tira la chevillette, et la porte s'ouvrit. Il se jeta sur la bonne femme, et la dévora en moins de rien ; car il y avait plus de trois jours qu'il n'avait mangé. Ensuite, il ferma la porte et s'alla coucher dans le lit de la mère-grand, en attendant le petit Chaperon rouge, qui quelque temps après vint heurter à la porte. Toc, toc. « Qui est là ? » Le petit Chaperon rouge, qui entendit la grosse voix du loup, eut peur d'abord, mais croyant que sa mère-grand était enrhumée, répondit : « C'est votre fille le petit Chaperon rouge, qui vous apporte une galette et un petit pot de beurre que ma mère vous envoie. » Le loup lui cria en adoucissant un peu sa voix : « Tire la chevillette, la bobinette cherra. » Le petit Chaperon rouge tira la chevillette, et la porte s'ouvrit.Le loup, la voyant entrer, lui dit en se cachant dans le lit sous la couverture : « Mets la galette et le petit pot de beurre sur la huche, et viens te coucher avec moi. » Le petit Chaperon rouge se déshabille, et va se mettre dans le lit, où elle fut bien étonnée de voir comment sa mère-grand était faite en son déshabillé. Elle lui dit : « Ma mère-grand, que vous avez de grands bras !— C'est pour mieux t'embrasser, ma fille.— Ma mère-grand, que vous avez de grandes jambes !— C'est pour mieux courir, mon enfant.— Ma mère-grand, que vous avez de grandes oreilles !— C'est pour mieux écouter, mon enfant.— Ma mère-grand, que vous avez de grands yeux !— C'est pour mieux voir, mon enfant.— Ma mère-grand, que vous avez de grandes dents !— C'est pour mieux te manger. »Et en disant ces mots, ce méchant loup se jeta sur le petit Chaperon rouge, et la mangea. La forêt est une étendue boisée dense, constituée d'arbres et d'arbustes, plus grande que le bois. Grâce à l'oxygène que les arbres produisent, la forêt a une fonction vitale : c'est le « poumon de la planète ».C'est un milieu de vie présentant une diversité animale et végétale, et aussi une source de revenus pour les hommes grâce à la sylviculture. Pour que celle-ci ne détruise pas la forêt, les forestiers veillent à son renouvellement en replantant des arbres, en coupant le bois mort, etc.  La forêt primaire se distingue de la forêt secondaire : la première est une forêt naturelle n'impliquant pas d'intervention humaine (moins de 10 % des forêts mondiales appartiennent à cette catégorie) ; la seconde est une forêt partiellement ou entièrement façonnée par l'homme. La forêt primaire diminue, car l'homme déboise beaucoup pour gagner des étendues de terres cultivables.Il existe plusieurs types de forêts : la taïga, la forêt tropicale, la forêt méditerranéenne et la forêt tempérée. Selon le type de forêt, la végétation n'est pas la même. Que dit le loup avant que le Petit Chaperon rouge n'entre dans la maison de la mère-grand ?  Que doit apporter le Petit Chaperon rouge à sa mère-grand ?  Quel pourcentage des forêts représentent les forêts primaires à l'échelle mondiale ?    Il était une fois une petite fille de village, la plus jolie qu'on eût su voir ; sa mère en était folle, et sa mère-grand plus folle encore. Cette bonne femme lui fit faire un petit chaperon rouge, qui lui seyait si bien que partout on l'appelait le petit Chaperon rouge.Un jour sa mère, ayant cuit et fait des galettes, lui dit : « Va voir comme se porte ta mère-grand, car on m'a dit qu'elle était malade, porte-lui une galette et ce petit pot de beurre. » Le petit Chaperon rouge partit aussitôt pour aller chez sa mère-grand, qui demeurait dans un autre village.

      "  Dans un petit village de Chine, non loin de la ville de Nankin, vivait un jeune homme prénommé Tao. Il était très pauvre, mais cela ne l'empêchait pas d'être généreux et toujours prêt à aider son prochain. Personne ne s'adressait à lui en vain. Un jour, alors que le soleil brillait déjà très haut dans le ciel, Tao, qui dormait sur une paillasse à l'ombre d'un arbre, fut réveillé assez brutalement par un inconnu. Surpris, il ouvrit les yeux et vit devant lui un homme tout de gris vêtu.« Réveille-toi, Tao, lui dit l'inconnu. La reine t'attend !— La reine ? s'étonna Tao. Mais je ne connais pas de reine !— Elle, en revanche, te connaît, poursuivit l'homme en gris, et elle m'a envoyé te chercher de toute urgence. Viens, suis-moi !— Mais qui êtes-vous donc ? demanda Tao au messager, je ne vous ai jamais vu ! » L'inconnu haussa les épaules : « À quoi cela t'avancerait-il de m'avoir déjà vu et de savoir qui je suis ? La reine a besoin de ton aide. Tu es bien Tao, celui qui ne refuse jamais son aide à personne ? » Tao n'osa plus poser de question. Il replia rapidement sa paillasse, et suivit l'inconnu. Ils marchèrent un long moment. À l'instant où Tao crut atteindre les dernières maisons du village, il découvrit devant lui une ville immense dont toutes les habitations, massées les unes contre les autres, présentaient une forme assez étrange, qui lui sembla vaguement familière.  L'inconnu pénétra dans l'une d'elles, plus vaste et somptueuse que les autres. Tao le suivit. Ils arrivèrent dans une salle immense, où une très belle femme était assise sur un trône majestueux. Elle portait dans les cheveux un diadème, qui scintillait de mille feux. « Merci d'être venu, murmura-t-elle. Mon royaume court un grand danger et tu es le seul à pouvoir le sauver. » Tao se courba dans un profond salut. « Ce sera un honneur pour moi, Votre Majesté », balbutia-t-il. « Je vais te présenter à ma fille, poursuivit la reine d'une voix douce. Je considère tous mes sujets comme mes propres enfants, mais je tiens à ma fille bien plus qu'à moi-même. » Tao crut entendre des milliers de clochettes d'or, et une jeune fille, également très belle, entra dans la pièce. Son visage était pâle comme le lys, et ses cheveux de jais coulaient en cascade le long de son dos. L'air infiniment triste, elle alla s'asseoir à côté de la reine, sur une chaise en or. À peine se fut-elle installée qu'une dame de la cour entra, tout essoufflée, en hurlant : « Le monstre, le monstre ! » La reine se leva. « Voilà le malheur dont je viens de te parler. Je t'en supplie, Tao, aide ma fille. Elle a pour mission de reconstruire une capitale, mais sans toi, jamais elle n'y parviendra. » Tao, sans hésiter une seconde, prit la jeune fille par la main et, ensemble, ils quittèrent le palais discrètement. Pendant des heures, ils coururent sans prendre le temps de retrouver leur souffle. Ils empruntèrent mille et une petites rues tortueuses, et parvinrent finalement au village de Tao. Là, ils purent souffler un peu.« Comme c'est calme, ici, soupira Fleur-de-Lotus, car c'est ainsi que la jeune princesse s'appelait.— Nous sommes loin de tout danger, à présent, dit Tao.— Où allons-nous bâtir la nouvelle capitale ? demanda la princesse.— Une capitale ? » demanda Tao, qui n'avait pas très bien compris lorsque la reine lui avait parlé dans son palais. « Mais je ne pourrai jamais construire une capitale. C'est impossible ! Je ne suis qu'un pauvre paysan. Je n'ai ni pouvoir ni argent. » La princesse le regarda, et de grosses larmes roulèrent sur ses joues. « Mais tu es pourtant bien Tao, celui qui est toujours prêt à aider son prochain, gémit-elle. Toi seul es capable de le faire…— Non, je… » s'apprêtait-il à dire lorsqu'il s'éveilla.  Il avait dû dormir longtemps, car le soleil se trouvait maintenant fort bas sur l'horizon. Bien qu'éveillé, Tao entendait encore la voix suppliante de Fleur-de-Lotus, qui semblait s'éloigner.En vérité, il s'agissait d'un essaim d'abeilles. Elles semblaient perdues et tournaient dans tous les sens autour des fleurs du jardin. « Pauvres bêtes, pensa Tao, elles n'ont pas de ruche ! Je vais leur en faire fabriquer une. » Et il se rendit immédiatement chez un charpentier. « Je me demande d'où peuvent bien venir toutes ces abeilles ? » pensa-t-il, lorsqu'il vit que les insectes acceptaient avec empressement leur nouveau refuge. Il partit se promener dans le village. Arrivé à hauteur de la dernière maison, il découvrit dans un jardin une ruche abandonnée.« J'ai trouvé des abeilles chez moi, dit-il à l'homme qui vivait là. Ne sont-elles pas à vous ?— C'est possible, répondit l'homme. Elles ont dû fuir, ajouta-t-il en ôtant le couvercle de la ruche. Comme il se penchait, il y découvrit un serpent. « Oh, le monstre de mon rêve ! », se dit Tao. De retour chez lui, il installa dans son jardin toute une rangée de belles ruches semblables. De tous les côtés, des abeilles arrivèrent. Elles se mirent à butiner ses fleurs et lui offrirent tellement de miel en échange de sa protection que Tao, le généreux, devint bientôt riche.   Le seul monument visible depuis la LuneLa Grande Muraille de Chine zigzague sur 5 000 kilomètres en suivant les ondulations des paysages. Sa construction commença il y a 2 000 ans.Elle devait protéger l'immense frontière du pays contre les attaques des peuples voisins. Tout le long de ses hauts murs crénelés se succèdent des postes d'observation, des tours d'alarme et des abris. Les soldats pouvaient ainsi voir arriver les ennemis de très loin et se transmettre des messages codés d'un bout à l'autre de la muraille !  Des pétards, des dragons, des lampions…Des pétards explosent partout… Des dragons multicolores défilent dans les rues… Des lampions décorent les maisons… Pendant une semaine, tous les Chinois fêtent leur changement d'année. La nuit du nouvel an, ils attendent minuit avec impatience : c'est l'heure des raviolis ! Dans ce plat se cachent trois raviolis spéciaux que chacun espère manger. L'un aux cacahuètes porte chance. L'autre, au sucre, assure une année agréable. Et le troisième contient une pièce de monnaie qui promet la richesse à celui qui tombe dessus.  Dans quel pays Tao vit-il ?  Quelle est la principale qualité de Tao ?  Quel bijou la reine porte-elle ?  Quelle est la couleur du jais ?  À son réveil Tao entreprend de construire :  Quel est le monstre du rêve de Tao ?  Quel plat traditionnel mange-t-on le soir du nouvel an chinois ?    Dans un petit village de Chine, non loin de la ville de Nankin, vivait un jeune homme prénommé Tao. Il était très pauvre, mais cela ne l'empêchait pas d'être généreux et toujours prêt à aider son prochain. Personne ne s'adressait à lui en vain.

      "   Le roi Keita, sur ses vieux jours, appela ses trois fils : l'aîné Mamadi, le cadet Mambi et le benjamin Kalilou. « Mes chers enfants, leur dit-il, je suis très âgé. Je me sens malade ce matin, et je pense n'avoir plus que quelques jours à vivre. Comme je vous aime bien, je vais vous donner en héritage quinze tonnes d'or. J'ai fait trois parts égales, les voici. » Et dans un grand coffre, à côté du lit du roi, apparurent les héritages respectifs des enfants.Le surlendemain, le roi Keita rendit l'âme.Les funérailles terminées, les deux aînés se demandèrent comment ils pourraient dépenser leur héritage. Ils achetèrent des troupeaux, firent construire des cases, parcoururent tout le pays pour offrir à leur mère et à leurs femmes les plus beaux bijoux, les plus belles étoffes. Puis ils passèrent leurs jours en festins continuels. L'argent, on le gaspillait.C'était à celui qui organiserait les plus belles fêtes, aurait les plus beaux tam-tams. Un jour, les mères de Mamadi et de Mambi rendirent visite à la mère de Kalilou. Elles se moquèrent d'elle et la ridiculisèrent en constatant qu'elle ne profitait pas de l'héritage de son fils. Après le départ des deux femmes, la mère de Kalilou, furieuse, se rendit aussitôt chez son fils.« Fils ingrat, cria-t-elle, tu ne m'offres jamais de cadeaux, tu n'organises jamais de fêtes. Vois un peu comment vivent tes deux frères, prends donc exemple sur eux… »Et elle fondit en larmes.Kalilou ne répondit rien mais partit dès le lendemain matin en voyage. Au premier village qu'il traversa, des enfants malmenaient un chien qu'ils tenaient en laisse. Ils le conduisaient au fleuve pour le noyer.« Pourquoi, chers enfants, voulez-vous tuer ce chien ?— Il a dévoré la viande du fils du roi.— Prenez cette poignée d'or et vendez-moi votre chien. »Les enfants, qui ne s'attendaient pas à pareille aubaine, n'hésitèrent pas un seul instant. Et Kalilou continua sa route, accompagné du chien. En entrant dans un deuxième village, il aperçut des petites filles qui pendaient un chat.« Pourquoi pendez-vous ce chat, fillettes ?— Parce qu'il a bu le lait du roi.— Prenez cette poignée d'or et vendez-moi votre chat. »Et Kalilou se remit en marche, suivi du chien et du chat.En entrant dans un troisième village, il vit un chasseur qui allait tuer un vautour.« Pourquoi, chasseur, veux-tu tuer ce vautour ?— Parce qu'il dévore les oiseaux du roi.— Tiens, voilà une poignée d'or et donne-moi ton vautour. »Et Kalilou, accompagné du chien, du chat et du vautour, à qui il avait sauvé la vie, reprit sa route. Ils arrivèrent bientôt dans un espace désert, où l'on remarquait simplement une grotte.« Homme, dit le vautour. Ici est mon logis. Entre dans cette caverne. Ne crains rien. »Tous y pénétrèrent. Sur un perchoir en or était juché le roi des vautours, entouré de ses sujets.« Grand chef des vautours, cria le rapace, je te présente l'homme qui m'a sauvé la vie. Il mérite une récompense.— Laquelle ?— Il mérite l'anneau. »Le chef des vautours quitta son superbe perchoir, vint se poser auprès de Kalilou, ouvrit son énorme bec et dit : « Homme, sous ma langue se trouve une bague magique. Prends-la, je t'en fais cadeau. Chaque fois que tu désireras quelque chose, dis-le, ton vœu sera tout de suite exaucé, mais surtout ne perds jamais cet anneau. » Kalilou prit l'anneau et répondit : « Je te remercie beaucoup, chef des vautours. » Puis : « Je désirerais rentrer de suite au village. »Il avait à peine terminé sa phrase qu'il fut chez lui. Sa mère vint le voir, le traita à nouveau d'enfant ingrat et se remit à pleurer.Kalilou sortit de la case, prit son anneau et dit : « Je désirerais être le chef d'un grand village et avoir un riche palais comme habitation. » Un vacarme épouvantable se fit entendre. La mère effrayée sortit de la case de son fils et vit une ville et un somptueux palais qui surgissaient de terre. « Chère mère, dit Kalilou, c'est là désormais que nous habiterons. » La pauvre femme n'en croyait ni ses yeux ni ses oreilles. Le lendemain, Kalilou se maria, mais il commit une grave imprudence. Il raconta à sa jeune épouse l'histoire de l'anneau magique. Profitant du profond sommeil de son mari, la femme lui déroba l'anneau et s'enfuit chez ses parents.Immédiatement, Kalilou se réveilla dans une pauvre case. Plus de palais, plus de ville ! Le chien et le chat se consultèrent et décidèrent de récupérer l'anneau du maître. Ils arrivèrent au village de la jeune femme, près de la case où elle logeait. Le chat dit : « Chien, reste près de la porte et tiens-toi prêt à t'enfuir. » Puis, il pénétra dans la case.La jeune femme était assise près du foyer. Le chat, en ronronnant, s'approcha d'elle.« Quel beau chat », fit la jeune épouse et elle le caressa, le prit sur ses genoux. L'animal se laissa faire.Brusquement, il sauta à la gorge de la femme qui, tout effrayée, recula en hurlant. La bague qu'elle tenait sous la langue tomba à terre. Le chat la prit, fuit vers la porte et bondit sur le dos du chien qui détala à toute vitesse. Quelle ne fut pas la joie de Kalilou quand il revit l'anneau !Son premier soin fut de souhaiter la mort de sa femme et depuis, il s'est bien juré de ne jamais dévoiler de secret à aucune femme, si gentille fût-elle. Dans l'histoire, de quoi les trois fils du roi héritent-ils ?  Dans l'histoire, que font les aînés de leur héritage ?  Dans l'histoire, quel est le premier animal recueilli par Kalilou ?  Dans l'histoire, qu'est-ce que le roi des vautours offre à Kalilou ?  Le Nil est le fleuve le plus long du monde. Vrai ou faux ?     Le roi Keita, sur ses vieux jours, appela ses trois fils : l'aîné Mamadi, le cadet Mambi et le benjamin Kalilou. « Mes chers enfants, leur dit-il, je suis très âgé. Je me sens malade ce matin, et je pense n'avoir plus que quelques jours à vivre. Comme je vous aime bien, je vais vous donner en héritage quinze tonnes d'or. J'ai fait trois parts égales, les voici. » Et dans un grand coffre, à côté du lit du roi, apparurent les héritages respectifs des enfants.Le surlendemain, le roi Keita rendit l'âme.Les funérailles terminées, les deux aînés se demandèrent comment ils pourraient dépenser leur héritage. Ils achetèrent des troupeaux, firent construire des cases, parcoururent tout le pays pour offrir à leur mère et à leurs femmes les plus beaux bijoux, les plus belles étoffes. Puis ils passèrent leurs jours en festins continuels. L'argent, on le gaspillait.C'était à celui qui organiserait les plus belles fêtes, aurait les plus beaux tam-tams. Un jour, les mères de Mamadi et de Mambi rendirent visite à la mère de Kalilou. Elles se moquèrent d'elle et la ridiculisèrent en constatant qu'elle ne profitait pas de l'héritage de son fils. Après le départ des deux femmes, la mère de Kalilou, furieuse, se rendit aussitôt chez son fils.« Fils ingrat, cria-t-elle, tu ne m'offres jamais de cadeaux, tu n'organises jamais de fêtes. Vois un peu comment vivent tes deux frères, prends donc exemple sur eux… »Et elle fondit en larmes.Kalilou ne répondit rien mais partit dès le lendemain matin en voyage. Au premier village qu'il traversa, des enfants malmenaient un chien qu'ils tenaient en laisse. Ils le conduisaient au fleuve pour le noyer.« Pourquoi, chers enfants, voulez-vous tuer ce chien ?— Il a dévoré la viande du fils du roi.— Prenez cette poignée d'or et vendez-moi votre chien. »Les enfants, qui ne s'attendaient pas à pareille aubaine, n'hésitèrent pas un seul instant. Et Kalilou continua sa route, accompagné du chien. En entrant dans un deuxième village, il aperçut des petites filles qui pendaient un chat.« Pourquoi pendez-vous ce chat, fillettes ?— Parce qu'il a bu le lait du roi.— Prenez cette poignée d'or et vendez-moi votre chat. »Et Kalilou se remit en marche, suivi du chien et du chat.En entrant dans un troisième village, il vit un chasseur qui allait tuer un vautour.« Pourquoi, chasseur, veux-tu tuer ce vautour ?— Parce qu'il dévore les oiseaux du roi.— Tiens, voilà une poignée d'or et donne-moi ton vautour. »Et Kalilou, accompagné du chien, du chat et du vautour, à qui il avait sauvé la vie, reprit sa route. Ils arrivèrent bientôt dans un espace désert, où l'on remarquait simplement une grotte.« Homme, dit le vautour. Ici est mon logis. Entre dans cette caverne. Ne crains rien. »Tous y pénétrèrent. Sur un perchoir en or était juché le roi des vautours, entouré de ses sujets.« Grand chef des vautours, cria le rapace, je te présente l'homme qui m'a sauvé la vie. Il mérite une récompense.— Laquelle ?— Il mérite l'anneau. »Le chef des vautours quitta son superbe perchoir, vint se poser auprès de Kalilou, ouvrit son énorme bec et dit : « Homme, sous ma langue se trouve une bague magique. Prends-la, je t'en fais cadeau. Chaque fois que tu désireras quelque chose, dis-le, ton vœu sera tout de suite exaucé, mais surtout ne perds jamais cet anneau. » Kalilou prit l'anneau et répondit : « Je te remercie beaucoup, chef des vautours. » Puis : « Je désirerais rentrer de suite au village. »Il avait à peine terminé sa phrase qu'il fut chez lui. Sa mère vint le voir, le traita à nouveau d'enfant ingrat et se remit à pleurer.Kalilou sortit de la case, prit son anneau et dit : « Je désirerais être le chef d'un grand village et avoir un riche palais comme habitation. » Un vacarme épouvantable se fit entendre. La mère effrayée sortit de la case de son fils et vit une ville et un somptueux palais qui surgissaient de terre. « Chère mère, dit Kalilou, c'est là désormais que nous habiterons. » La pauvre femme n'en croyait ni ses yeux ni ses oreilles. Le lendemain, Kalilou se maria, mais il commit une grave imprudence. Il raconta à sa jeune épouse l'histoire de l'anneau magique. Profitant du profond sommeil de son mari, la femme lui déroba l'anneau et s'enfuit chez ses parents.Immédiatement, Kalilou se réveilla dans une pauvre case. Plus de palais, plus de ville ! Le chien et le chat se consultèrent et décidèrent de récupérer l'anneau du maître. Ils arrivèrent au village de la jeune femme, près de la case où elle logeait. Le chat dit : « Chien, reste près de la porte et tiens-toi prêt à t'enfuir. » Puis, il pénétra dans la case.La jeune femme était assise près du foyer. Le chat, en ronronnant, s'approcha d'elle.« Quel beau chat », fit la jeune épouse et elle le caressa, le prit sur ses genoux. L'animal se laissa faire.Brusquement, il sauta à la gorge de la femme qui, tout effrayée, recula en hurlant. La bague qu'elle tenait sous la langue tomba à terre. Le chat la prit, fuit vers la porte et bondit sur le dos du chien qui détala à toute vitesse. Quelle ne fut pas la joie de Kalilou quand il revit l'anneau !Son premier soin fut de souhaiter la mort de sa femme et depuis, il s'est bien juré de ne jamais dévoiler de secret à aucune femme, si gentille fût-elle.\n",

      "  Un jour, Täne Mahuta marchait à travers la forêt. Il regardait les arbres et il remarqua qu'ils commençaient à être malades. Des insectes mangeaient leurs feuilles et l'écorce. Il le rapporta à son frère, Täne Hokahoka, qui savait parler aux oiseaux. Täne Mahuta dit :« Les arbres sont malades. Il faut que l'une des espèces d'oiseaux descende de la cime des arbres et vive sur le sol, pour que les arbres soient sauvés. Qui voudra venir ? »Tout était silencieux, et aucun oiseau ne répondit. Täne Hokahoka se tourna vers Tui :« Tui, descendras-tu de la cime des arbres ? »Tui regarda vers la cime des arbres et vit le soleil filtrer entre les feuilles. Tui regarda vers le sol sombre et froid, et frissonna.« Non, Täne Hokahoka, il y fait trop noir et je suis effrayé par le noir. » Täne Hokahoka se tourna vers Pükeko :« Pükeko, descendras-tu de la cime des arbres ? »Pükeko regarda vers la cime des arbres et vit le soleil filtrer entre les feuilles. Pükeko regarda vers le sol froid et humide et frissonna.« Non, Täne Hokahoka, c'est trop humide et je ne veux pas me mouiller les pattes. » Täne Hokahoka se tourna vers Pipiwharauroa :« Pipiwharauroa, descendras-tu de la cime des arbres ? »Pipiwharauroa regarda vers la cime des arbres et vit le soleil filtrer entre les feuilles. Pipiwharauroa regarda autour de lui et vit sa famille.« Non, Täne Hokahoka, car je suis occupé en ce moment à construire mon nid. »  Täne Hokahoka était bien triste, car il savait que si aucun oiseau ne descendait, non seulement son frère perdrait les arbres, mais les oiseaux n'auraient plus de maison. Täne Hokahoka se tourna vers Kiwi :« Kiwi, descendras-tu de la cime des arbres ? »Kiwi regarda vers la cime des arbres et vit le soleil filtrer entre les feuilles. Il regarda autour de lui et vit sa famille, puis il regarda la terre froide et humide. Il regarda une fois de plus autour de lui, se tourna vers Täne Hokahoka et dit :« Je viendrai. »Täne Hokahoka et Täne Mahuta se réjouirent, car ce petit oiseau allait sauver la forêt par sa générosité. Mais Täne Mahuta voulait prévenir Kiwi de ce qui allait arriver.« Kiwi, est-ce que tu réalises que, si tu fais ça, tu devras avoir des jambes fortes et épaisses pour pouvoir marcher sur le sol, tu perdras tes magnifiques plumes colorées et tes ailes, tu ne pourras plus jamais retourner sur la cime des arbres, et tu ne verras plus jamais le soleil d'aussi près. »Kiwi regarda une dernière fois le soleil filtrer à travers les feuilles, et lui adressa un adieu silencieux. Kiwi regarda les autres oiseaux et leurs plumes colorées, et leur adressa un adieu silencieux. Il regarda autour de lui encore une fois, se tourna vers Täne Hokahoka, et dit :« Je viendrai. » Alors Täne Hokahoka se tourna vers les autres oiseaux, et leur parla ainsi :« Tui, parce que tu étais effrayé à l'idée de descendre de la cime des arbres, à partir de maintenant tu porteras deux plumes blanches à la gorge comme marque de ta couardise. Pükeko, puisque tu ne voulais pas avoir tes pieds mouillés, tu vivras pour toujours dans les marais. Pipiwharauroa, parce tu étais trop occupé à construire ton nid, à partir de maintenant tu ne construiras plus jamais de nid, mais tu déposeras tes œufs dans les nids des autres. Mais toi, Kiwi, par ton grand sacrifice, tu deviendras le plus connu et le plus aimé de tous les oiseaux. » Allez les All Blacks !Les Néo-Zélandais adorent le rugby ! À chaque match, l'équipe des All Blacks, championne du ballon ovale, fait vibrer tout le pays. Pour s'encourager sur le terrain, les joueurs se réunissent en cercle au cri des chants guerriers maoris : « Hakka ! »  « Ne pas déranger la terre ! »C'est le message des Maoris, les premiers habitants de Nouvelle-Zélande. Ici en effet, la nature est reine. Souvent arrosées par les pluies, les deux grandes îles du pays sont bien vertes. La majorité de la population vit sur l'île du Nord, une terre volcanique qui fume et bouillonne. Les montagnes enneigées traversent l'île du Sud, plus froide, avec ses lacs et ses rivières. Des moutons pour tousIl y a 20 fois plus de moutons que de Néo-Zélandais ! Nourries d'herbe fraîche, ces bêtes donnent une viande tendre et du bon lait. Avec leur laine, les habitants tricotent de gros pulls pour l'hiver.  Quel oiseau accepte de descendre de la cime des arbres ?  Qui sont les premiers habitants de la Nouvelle-Zélande ?  Quel est l'animal le plus répandu en Nouvelle-Zélande ?    Un jour, Täne Mahuta marchait à travers la forêt. Il regardait les arbres et il remarqua qu'ils commençaient à être malades.

      "  Il était une fois deux frères : l'un était pauvre, l'autre avait du bien.Le premier avait quatre filles ; le riche était sans enfant.Le pauvre, pour pouvoir nourrir sa famille, coupait du bois qu'il vendait à la ville. Un jour, c'était jour de fête ; il n'avait chez lui rien à manger. Il partit couper du bois.Un jujubier sauvage lui dit : « Que me veux-tu aujourd'hui ? C'est fête et j'invoque Dieu.— J'ai faim, dit le bûcheron ; donne-moi de quoi manger, sinon je te coupe.— Prends cette marmite, répondit le jujubier, et garde-la ; elle te nourrira jusqu'à ta mort. Quand tu voudras quelque chose, dis-le-lui ; elle te le donnera. »  Le bûcheron emporta la marmite chez lui, la tourna par terre et lui dit : « Donne-moi du bien. — Voilà », dit-elle, en faisant apparaître un tas de pièces d'or.Le pauvre, qui l'était moins maintenant, en profita pour acheter des habits à ses enfants. Mais une de ses filles, en visite chez son oncle, raconta l'incroyable histoire.« Il y a chez nous une marmite remplie de richesses. »Le frère se rendit chez le bûcheron.« Donne-moi la marmite que tu possèdes pour que je nourrisse mes hôtes. — Je ne te la donnerai pas, car c'est elle qui fait vivre mes enfants. — Si tu ne me la donnes pas, je te tue. »Le bûcheron eut peur. Il donna la marmite à son frère et se mit à pleurer. « Demeurez en paix, dit-il à ses enfants ; puisque je ne peux subvenir à vos besoins, je m'en vais errer dans le pays. »Le pauvre homme partit, resta absent pendant trois mois sans revenir à la ville. Lorsque le jour de fête arriva de nouveau, il se rendit à l'endroit où se trouvait le jujubier sauvage qu'il frappa de sa hache tranchante.Une femme en sortit, le salua et dit : « Pourquoi n'es-tu pas rassasié ?— La marmite que tu m'as donnée m'a été prise par mon frère ; je n'ai pas pu l'en empêcher.— Attends-moi ici », dit-elle. Puis elle rentra dans l'arbre et apporta un grand bâton.« Quand tu seras près de la ville, tu t'arrêteras jusqu'à ce que les gens soient dans la mosquée ; alors lâche ton bâton et dis-lui : \"Prends mon droit à ceux qui m'ont lésé.\" »Le bûcheron prit le bâton et se rendit à la porte de la mosquée. Lorsque les gens sortirent de la prière, le bâton lui échappa et frappa tous les assistants sans exception. Chacun s'en retourna à la mosquée et les chefs dirent : « L'injustice est descendue dans la ville. Dieu pèse sur nous ; que celui qui a été lésé se présente ; nous lui rendrons son dû.— Le propriétaire du bâton est à la porte de la mosquée et pleure, dit quelqu'un.— Entre, lui dit-on ; indique-nous celui qui t'a pris ton bien.— C'est mon frère qui m'a enlevé de force ma marmite.— Demande ce que tu veux.— Rendez-moi ma marmite et partagez la fortune de mon frère entre lui et moi, car j'ai des enfants et il n'en a pas. »On lui donna ce qu'il voulait, et l'on invoqua Dieu qui envoya une forte pluie parce que la justice avait triomphé.  Les objets magiques de ce conte : l'arbre conseiller, le bâton défenseur et la marmite nourricière, sont des symboles que l'on retrouve souvent dans les contes de toutes les cultures, avec quelques variantes. Le jujubier sauvage est une sorte d'être protecteur. D'ailleurs, il en sort une femme qui a des pouvoirs magiques, comme une fée. On retrouve souvent des arbres magiques dans les histoires. Dans Les présents des génies de l'eau, conte africain, c'est un baobab qui explique au lièvre comment trouver la richesse. Le bâton, comme une baguette magique, obéit à son possesseur. Il le défend ici contre l'injustice. C'est le cas dans de nombreux contes. Par exemple, dans Bâton tape, un conte américain, le héros rencontre une vieille dame qui s'avère être une fée. Cette dernière lui confie un bâton qui tapera sur le voleur et lui permettra de retrouver ses biens. La marmite est le symbole du foyer et de la nourriture. Dans La soupe au caillou par exemple, un conte d'Asie, elle permet de faire une délicieuse soupe aux habitants du village qui finissent par devenir amis. Toujours dans Bâton tape, c'est une nappe et une poule, également symboles d'un bon repas, qui permettent à la famille pauvre de ne pas mourir de faim. Le frère pauvre est :  Quel arbre s'adresse à l'homme pauvre de ce conte berbère ?  Que contient la marmite ?    Il était une fois deux frères : l'un était pauvre, l'autre avait du bien.Le premier avait quatre filles ; le riche était sans enfant.Le pauvre, pour pouvoir nourrir sa famille, coupait du bois qu'il vendait à la ville.

      "  Le sixième petit matin de la création, Papabondieu, accoudé au balcon du ciel, considérait avec une certaine satisfaction les étoiles, innombrables loupiotes qui s'éteignent au lever du jour. Papabondieu trouvait que tout cela était bon.Il baissa les yeux et admira les océans, les fleuves, les lacs qui regorgeaient de bêtes à écailles, de dauphins et d'autres mammifères colossaux et microscopiques. Il admira de même la terre tout égayée de bêtes à cornes, de bêtes à poils gigantesques et minuscules. Il s'émerveilla de voir, dans les airs, quantité de bêtes à plumes de tout poil. Papabondieu trouvait que tout cela était bon.  Il décida alors de créer l'humanité. Il prit de l'argile et fit trois boules, deux petites pour deux têtes et une grosse, pour un ventre. Avec un long boudin, il fit quatre bras et quatre jambes. Il rassembla le tout auquel il donna deux sexes et posa cette créature androgyne sur le sol.L'humanité fraîchement créée se mit à rouler à grand fracas, s'appuyant tantôt sur les mains tantôt sur les pieds. Papabondieu arrivait à supporter ce vacarme car il avait une grande capacité de concentration, mais la vitesse avec laquelle la créature androgyne se reproduisait le laissait pantois. « Il est à craindre qu'à ce rythme, il n'y aura, d'ici peu, plus de place pour tout ce monde sur terre. » Papabondieu ne fit ni une ni deux, il dégaina sa machette et… raaaa ! coupa son œuvre en deux moitiés.Pour la première fois, l'humanité divisée en mâles et femelles se retrouva debout sur ses pieds et se mit à courir, courir, courir. Où allait-elle et, grand dieu, que cherchait-t-elle ? Chacun cherchait la moitié qu'on lui avait enlevée. Beaucoup la cherchent encore. Il y a tant de monde sur terre que ce n'est pas chose facile de tomber sur la bonne moitié. Quand on se trompe, c'est la déveine, mais quand on la trouve, c'est le bonheur.  Comme Papabondieu dans l'histoire, tu peux réaliser facilement des personnages, des animaux, des étoiles… en pâte à sel ! Les ingrédients et les ustensilesDe l'eau du robinet. De la farine bon marché. Du sel fin. Un saladier. Une cuillère en bois. Une tasse ou un verre.    La réalisation • Remplis deux tasses de farine et verse-les dans le saladier. • Remplis une tasse de sel et verse-la sur la farine. • Remplis la moitié d'une tasse d'eau et verse-la sur la farine et le sel. • Mélange avec la cuillère en bois jusqu'à ce que la pâte épaississe. • Pétris la pâte à la main pour qu'elle devienne malléable comme de la pâte à modeler. Si elle est trop dure, ajoute un peu d'eau. Si elle est trop liquide, ajoute un peu de farine. La pâte ne doit pas être trop collante. • Malaxe la pâte avec les mains et confectionne des boules et des boudins de différentes tailles pour former une tête, un corps, des bras et des jambes…  Une fois tes personnages terminés, laisse-les sécher pendant une demi-journée dans un endroit sec, cela évite que tes réalisations se déforment à la cuisson.Demande ensuite à un adulte de les passer au four pendant environ une heure (entre 75°C et 110°C, si le four est plus chaud, la pâte va gonfler).Le temps de cuisson dépend du temps de séchage, de la grosseur de l'objet à cuire et de la quantité d'eau que tu as mis dans la pâte : plus il y en a, plus c'est long ! Comme pour les gâteaux, il faut surveiller la cuisson de tes réalisations.Une fois qu'elles sont dures, tu peux les sortir du four. S'il te reste de la pâte à sel fraîche, range-la dans un sac en plastique, tu pourras la réutiliser plus tard. L'histoire débute le :  Dans le ciel, qu'est-ce qui ressemblent à des loupiotes ?

      "  Il y a longtemps de cela, les caravanes de pionniers, formées de chariots couverts tirés par des chevaux, quittaient les côtes de l'Atlantique pour atteindre les grandes plaines d'Amérique du Nord. Après un voyage épuisant, les hommes atteignaient les montagnes Rocheuses. Puis, non sans avoir parcouru encore un long chemin, ils finissaient par arriver dans une grande vallée entourée de hautes montagnes. C'était une plaine de sable blanc, dans un pays où la pluie ne tombait presque jamais. Cependant, les neiges éternelles, sur le sommet des montagnes, alimentaient de nombreux petits ruisseaux qui descendaient le long des pentes et venaient se jeter dans un beau lac bleu, au milieu de la plaine de sable, une petite mer intérieure, salée comme la grande mer.C'est là que certains pionniers s'arrêtèrent, au lac Salé. Ils bâtirent des cabanes pour passer l'hiver. Ils avaient mis tant de mois pour faire ce terrible voyage que beaucoup d'entre eux étaient morts en cours de route, à cause du froid, de la fatigue, de la maladie et, une fois sur place, beaucoup d'autres moururent encore pendant l'hiver. Les provisions de ceux qui avaient survécu étaient presque épuisées, et leur vie dépendait de la récolte qui allait mûrir. À force de courage et de travail, ils avaient rendu le pays fertile en construisant des canaux pour l'eau des ruisseaux, et ils avaient pu ainsi semer du maïs, du blé et des légumes verts. Ce qui constituait leur subsistance ainsi que celle de leur bétail. À présent, ils attendaient…  Le printemps vint et le blé poussa, le maïs poussa aussi, ainsi que tous les légumes. La terre brune de la plaine était couverte de petites tiges vertes et tendres qui grossissaient à vue d'œil. La joie était dans tous les cœurs ; les pionniers étaient récompensés de tous leurs sacrifices. Une vie nouvelle et prospère s'ouvrait à eux quand, soudain, une chose terrible arriva…Un matin, les hommes qui veillaient à l'irrigation virent un grand nuage noir passer sur la colline et s'avancer vers la plaine. D'abord, ils eurent peur que la grêle ne détruise leurs récoltes, mais ils entendirent bien vite un bruit dans l'air, comme un roulement, et quand le nuage fut plus près, ils virent qu'il était formé d'un nombre incroyable de sauterelles ! Elles s'abattirent sur les champs, dévorant aussitôt les plantes. Les hommes tentèrent de les tuer, mais plus ils en éliminaient, plus il en venait ! Ils allumèrent des feux, creusèrent des fossés. Rien n'y faisait. De nouveaux bataillons de sauterelles arrivaient pour remplacer celles qui étaient détruites ! Épuisés, malheureux, les gens tombèrent à genoux, qui pleurant et criant, qui priant pour la délivrance.  Tout à coup, dans le lointain, dans le ciel, au-dessus du lac bleu, on entendit un bruissement d'ailes et des petits cris sauvages. Le bruit enfla, et les gens levèrent la tête. S'agissait-il encore de sauterelles ? Non. C'était une horde de mouettes. Rapides, battant l'air de leurs ailes blanches, les mouettes arrivaient par centaines, par milliers. « Des mouettes, des mouettes ! criait-on de tous côtés. Qu'est-ce que cela veut dire ? » Les mouettes planaient au-dessus des têtes, poussant de petits cris aigus, puis, tout à coup, elles plongèrent vers la foule, comme un immense nuage blanc. « Malheur, malheur ! crièrent les pauvres gens. Nous sommes perdus ! Tout ce que les sauterelles ont laissé, les mouettes vont le manger ! » Mais soudain, quelqu'un s'écria : « Regardez ! Les mouettes mangent les sauterelles ! » Et c'était bien vrai. Les mouettes dévoraient les sauterelles par milliers. Elles en avalaient jusqu'à n'en plus pouvoir, puis s'envolaient vers le lac, tandis que d'autres arrivaient avec une nouvelle ardeur. Et quand, à la fin, elles reprirent le chemin de leurs nids, il ne restait plus une sauterelle dans les champs, et le peuple fut sauvé. Depuis ce jour, dans la colonie du lac Salé, on apprend aux enfants à respecter les mouettes. Et lorsque les écoliers commencent à dessiner et à écrire, bien souvent, leur tout premier dessin est celui d'une mouette.  Un pays aux mille visagesLes États-Unis ? Ce sont les grandes villes où hurlent les sirènes des voitures de police, comme à Washington DC, la capitale. Ce sont aussi les immenses espaces du Far West : terre des cow-boys, des déserts de cactus et des canyons de roche rouge… C'est enfin Hollywood et ses stars de cinéma… Quels insectes ravagent les récoltes des pionniers ?  Quels oiseaux sauvent les récoltes ?  Quels bâtiments peut-on voir dans les grandes villes américaines ?  Que peut-on voir sur le drapeau américain ?  Retrouve le drapeau américain.  Quel sport pratique-t-on surtout aux États-Unis ?    Il y a longtemps de cela, les caravanes de pionniers, formées de chariots couverts tirés par des chevaux, quittaient les côtes de l'Atlantique pour atteindre les grandes plaines d'Amérique du Nord. Après un voyage épuisant, les hommes atteignaient les montagnes Rocheuses. Puis, non sans avoir parcouru encore un long chemin, ils finissaient par arriver dans une grande vallée entourée de hautes montagnes. C'était une plaine de sable blanc, dans un pays où la pluie ne tombait presque jamais. Cependant, les neiges éternelles, sur le sommet des montagnes, alimentaient de nombreux petits ruisseaux qui descendaient le long des pentes et venaient se jeter dans un beau lac bleu, au milieu de la plaine de sable, une petite mer intérieure, salée comme la grande mer.C'est là que certains pionniers s'arrêtèrent, au lac Salé. Ils bâtirent des cabanes pour passer l'hiver. Ils avaient mis tant de mois pour faire ce terrible voyage que beaucoup d'entre eux étaient morts en cours de route, à cause du froid, de la fatigue, de la maladie et, une fois sur place, beaucoup d'autres moururent encore pendant l'hiver. Les provisions de ceux qui avaient survécu étaient presque épuisées, et leur vie dépendait de la récolte qui allait mûrir. À force de courage et de travail, ils avaient rendu le pays fertile en construisant des canaux pour l'eau des ruisseaux, et ils avaient pu ainsi semer du maïs, du blé et des légumes verts. Ce qui constituait leur subsistance ainsi que celle de leur bétail. À présent, ils attendaient…  Le printemps vint et le blé poussa, le maïs poussa aussi, ainsi que tous les légumes.

      "  Le Soleil un jour dit à la Lune :« Ma chère amie, nous avons beaucoup trop d'enfants, qui nous causent bien du tourment, mangeons-les.— Je suis de votre avis, répondit la Lune, mais ce serait trop horrible de manger ses propres enfants. Envoyez-moi chaque jour un des vôtres, et je vous ferai servir, en retour, un des miens. »Le Soleil accepta et la Lune reçut dès le lendemain un des fils de son ami. Elle n'y toucha pas, mais l'arrosant d'une nouvelle sauce, le renvoya au Soleil qui, sans se méfier et croyant qu'il s'agissait d'un enfant de la Lune, le mangea.Ainsi firent-ils tous les jours… Et le Soleil perdit tous ses enfants. La Lune, par contre, conserva tous les siens. C'est pourquoi on peut voir, le jour, le Soleil seul au firmament, tandis que la Lune, la nuit, est entourée de sa nombreuse progéniture d'étoiles.  Lorsque le Soleil comprit la trahison de son amie, il s'élança furieux après elle et la poursuite continue encore de nos jours. Parfois, il arrive que le Soleil rattrape la vieille coquine de Lune et commence à la dévorer. Alors, les villageois, effrayés à l'idée que le Soleil réussisse à accomplir sa vengeance et quitte le monde des hommes, le privant ainsi de sa chaleur et de sa lumière, crient en frappant sur des calebasses : « Lâche-la, lâche-la. »Et le Soleil, impressionné par le bruit, renonce, mais pour un temps seulement, à sa vengeance.  La Lune est l'astre le plus proche de la Terre. Ce n'est pas une planète car elle ne tourne pas autour du Soleil. En revanche, elle tourne autour de la Terre en un mois environ.La Lune ne produit pas de lumière, elle reflète celle du Soleil. C'est pourquoi elle semble si brillante !  Les étoiles sont des astres qui « flottent » dans l'espace, comme la Terre. Et si elles paraissent petites, c'est parce qu'elles sont très loin de nous. Les étoiles naissent, vivent et finissent par s'éteindre. La durée de vie d'une étoile est de plusieurs millions à plusieurs milliards d'années !  Le Soleil est une grosse boule de gaz très chaud ; il s'agit d'une étoile. Il est assez proche de la Terre pour que nous sentions sa chaleur et percevions sa lumière.Le Soleil est énorme ! Son diamètre est de 1,4 million de kilomètres… En comparaison, la Terre est 110 fois plus petite !  Qui cause bien du tourment à la Lune et au Soleil ?  Que décident de faire le Soleil et la Lune à leurs enfants ?  Que crient les villageois au Soleil ?

      "Un jour, le père partit dans la montagne avec ses fils pour chasser la perdrix. La chance ne leur avait pas vraiment souri, mais ils purent tout de même accrocher quelques oiseaux à leur ceinture. Fatigués après une longue marche, ils s'assirent dans un pré pour se reposer. Les garçons s'assoupirent mais leur père resta éveillé. Soudain, il vit une pierre bouger, puis basculer. Une route apparut alors et sur celle-ci marchait une petite fille. « Dieu miséricordieux ! C'est ma fille ! » se dit le père. Il était près de l'appeler, lorsqu'il se ravisa, persuadé qu'il devait y avoir quelque magie là-dessous.La petite fille agissait comme si elle ne voyait ni son père ni ses frères. Elle s'assit dans l'herbe et se mit à jouer avec la poupée confectionnée par sa maman et avec des cailloux. Quelques instants plus tard, une voix venue des profondeurs de la Terre se fit entendre : « Rentre à la maison, ma petite fille, le déjeuner est servi ! » Quand il l'entendit, l'homme fit rapidement un signe de croix, car il avait reconnu la voix de sa femme ! La petite fille prit alors ses jouets et rentra sous terre. La pierre se remit aussitôt en place et tout redevint comme avant. Le père réveilla alors ses fils, leur raconta tout ce qu'il avait vu et leur dit : « Demain, à midi, nous reviendrons ici et si votre sœur réapparaît, nous l'attraperons et l'emporterons à la maison ! » Ils décidèrent de ne rien dire à leur retour, pour le moment, afin que la mère ne se désespère pas si, par malheur, ils n'arrivaient pas à arracher l'enfant au pouvoir maléfique. Le lendemain, ils se rendirent à nouveau dans le pré, se cachèrent derrière les pierres et attendirent. Soudain, l'une des pierres bougea, puis bascula, laissant apparaître un chemin. La petite fille s'installa et se mit à jouer avec sa poupée et ses cailloux. Le père et les frères s'approchèrent d'elle sans faire de bruit et l'attrapèrent par les bras et par les jambes. La petite fille se mit à crier et à appeler comme si on l'écorchait vive, car elle n'avait reconnu ni ses frères ni son père : « Maman, maman ! Viens à mon secours ! » Capusa sortit des entrailles de la Terre sous l'aspect de sa vraie mère. La ressemblance était telle que l'homme en resta comme pétrifié. « Que fais-tu là ? » laissa-t-il échapper. Il faillit lâcher sa petite fille, quand le vent, qui se mit à souffler, souleva la jupe de la femme. Apercevant les pattes de vautour de Capusa, ils comprirent tous alors à qui ils avaient affaire. « Sainte Vierge, protège-nous ! » s'écria le père en faisant un signe de croix. Ses fils firent de même et le fantôme perdit aussitôt son pouvoir. Il resta près de la pierre incapable de prononcer un mot. Le père prit la petite fille dans ses bras et se mit à courir en dévalant la pente. Mais la petite fille ne cessait pas de pleurer et continuait à répéter : « Maman, maman ! Viens à mon secours ! » Ils pensèrent que, dès qu'elle verrait sa vraie mère, la maison, le jardin, la petite fille retrouverait la mémoire. Mais elle était ensorcelée et ne reconnaissait rien de ce qui avait bercé son enfance. En vain, sa mère la serrait dans ses bras, lui chantait des berceuses et coiffait ses cheveux. La petite fille ne faisait que pleurer et appeler sa mère. Elle ne voulait même pas manger et ne buvait que de l'eau. Aussi, elle s'affaiblissait de jour en jour. Son père décida alors d'aller voir une guérisseuse des corps et des âmes. La route fut très longue et la vieille femme demanda beaucoup d'argent pour louer ses services, mais qu'est-ce que des parents ne feraient pas pour sauver leur enfant d'une malédiction ? Le père accepta et porta la guérisseuse sur son dos afin d'être, au plus vite, de retour à la maison. Quand elle vit la petite fille couchée sur son lit, presque sans âme, la guérisseuse comprit aussitôt ce qui s'était passé. « Votre fille a été ensorcelée par Capusa. Dans son corps se trouve une ombre noire qui voile tous ses souvenirs. C'est pourquoi elle ne se rappelle pas son passé. Apportez-moi deux épis de maïs, je vais essayer de vous aider. »Ils lui apportèrent ce qu'elle avait demandé et la femme commença à frotter le corps de la petite fille avec les épis de maïs tout en récitant des prières. Petit à petit, les grains jaunes des épis devenaient noirs. C'était l'ombre qui sortait du corps de la petite fille. Quand la dernière graine eut noirci, la petite fille ouvrit les yeux et s'écria : « Maman ! Papa ! J'ai fait un drôle de rêve ! » Tous se réjouirent de sa guérison et du fait qu'elle ne se souvenait plus de Capusa. La guérisseuse ordonna ensuite de faire brûler les épis noircis dans la cheminée, pour que le mauvais esprit soit définitivement chassé. Depuis lors, toute la famille vit heureuse. Et, comme ils racontent leur histoire à toutes les personnes qu'ils croisent sur leur chemin, les enfants apprennent ce qu'il faut faire chaque fois qu'un inconnu les interpelle. Ils doivent baisser la tête et regarder attentivement les jambes de la personne, car Capusa, ne pouvant pas les transformer, est ainsi trahi à chaque fois qu'il veut s'emparer d'un enfant. Comment s'appelle le fantôme de ce conte ?  À quoi reconnaît-on le fantôme de ce conte ?  Le vautour est nécrophage. Cela signifie qu'il se nourrit essentiellement :  À quelle idée est associé le vautour dans les civilisations occidentales ?  On reconnaît le vautour à :  Un jour, le père partit dans la montagne avec ses fils pour chasser la perdrix.

      "  L'hyène vint un jour trouver le lièvre et lui dit : « Allons chercher des ceintures de verroterie pour nos femmes. »L'hyène ramassa des graines de karité, les traversa d'un fil et donna sept ceintures de cette sorte à sa femelle.Le lièvre, lui, passa trois jours dans la brousse sans trouver ce qu'il désirait. Enfin, las de cette recherche vaine, il vint se reposer sous un baobab. « Ah ! s'écria-t-il, que l'ombre de cet arbre est donc agréable ! — Goûte de mes feuilles ! répondit le baobab. Elles te seront plus agréables encore que mon ombre ! » Le lièvre cueillit une feuille et la mangea.« C'est vrai, dit-il. C'est délicieux ! — Mon fruit est encore meilleur au goût ! — Si je pouvais en avoir beaucoup, j'en ferais commerce et je deviendrais très riche ! déclara le lièvre.— C'est donc la richesse que tu cherches ?— Oui.— Eh bien ! vois à l'intérieur », dit l'arbre dont le tronc s'ouvrit alors. Le lièvre regarda et vit de l'or, des colliers, des bijoux, des vêtements somptueux, des richesses de toute sorte. Il tendit la patte vers toutes ces choses désirables.« Attends un peu ! conseilla le baobab. Ce n'est pas ici que tu trouveras ce qu'il te faut. Va dans le champ de tomates : tu y rencontreras celui qui te donnera tout ce que tu peux souhaiter. »  Le lièvre passa dans le champ voisin. Il y trouva un petit génie des eaux en train de manger des tomates. Quand celui-ci l'aperçut, il lui cria : « Ne me tue pas ! Je sais pourquoi tu viens ici et je peux te procurer ce que tu cherches. Accompagne-moi dans les profondeurs du marais, mais garde-toi bien de rire de ce qui se passera sous tes yeux.« D'abord, mon père reviendra du pâturage. Il voudra poser sa houlette contre le mur, mais ce sera le bâton qui saisira mon père et le placera contre ce même mur. « De même, lorsque ma mère rentrera, portant un fagot qu'elle voudra jeter à terre, c'est elle-même que tu verras rudement jetée sur le sol par le fagot.« Ensuite, ma mère tuera une poule à ton attention, mais elle t'en apportera les plumes rôties au lieu de la viande. Mange les plumes comme s'il n'y avait rien de plus naturel. »Le lièvre promit d'obéir en tout point. Le petit génie le mena alors au fond du fleuve et tout se passa comme prévu. Le lièvre passa sept jours en compagnie de ses nouveaux amis. Le matin du septième jour, le chef du village aquatique sortit de sa case. « Notre chef va convoquer tout son peuple, dit le petit génie au lièvre. On te présentera deux calebasses. Prends la plus petite des deux.— C'est bien compris ! » répondit le lièvre. Et en effet, il choisit la plus petite des calebasses qu'on lui donna à choisir. On lui recommanda de ne l'ouvrir qu'une fois rendu chez lui. Le lendemain matin, les génies le firent sortir du fleuve sans qu'il eût un seul poil de mouillé.Il rentra chez lui et ouvrit alors seulement la calebasse. Elle renfermait des trésors de toute sorte, en quantité. Il en fit cadeau à sa femme. Lorsque celle-ci parut au puits, couverte de bijoux, la femme de l'hyène en ressentit une si furieuse jalousie que, de rage, elle cassa les fils des ceintures que son mari lui avait offertes. Elle rentra au plus vite au logis et apostropha celui-ci : « Tu n'es bon à rien ! lui cria-t-elle. La femme du lièvre a de belles ceintures d'or et les miennes sont faites de graines d'arbre ! Si tu ne m'en apportes pas de pareilles, je m'en retournerai chez mon père et tu ne me reverras plus ! »L'hyène prit alors un morceau de charbon. « Je saurai bien, dit-elle, où le lièvre s'est procuré tout cela ! » Elle alla se poster en gémissant derrière la case du malin compère. Celui-ci vint s'informer de la cause de ces cris. « Ah ! geignit l'hyène, depuis une semaine j'ai des rages de dents ; un abcès s'est formé et maintenant le pus, cessant de couler, s'est durci. Toi qui es plus adroit que moi, tu dois pouvoir me le retirer. — Comment puis-je être sûr que tu n'en profiteras pas pour manger ma patte ? s'inquiéta le lièvre.— Voyons, comment un malade pourrait-il manger celui qui l'a guéri ? »Rassuré, le lièvre entreprit alors de soigner l'hyène. Il introduisit sa patte dans la gueule de l'hyène qui aussitôt referma ses mâchoires. « Je ne ferai qu'une bouchée de ta patte, si tu ne me dis pas où tu as trouvé tous les cadeaux que tu as faits à ta femme. — C'est d'accord ! » répondit immédiatement le lièvre tout tremblant. Le lièvre mena alors l'hyène sous le baobab et l'arbre lui parla comme il avait fait au lièvre. L'hyène se rendit dans le champ de tomates et commença par brutaliser le petit génie. Celui-ci la prévint alors de rester impassible devant les spectacles qui lui inspireraient la plus forte envie de rire, mais l'hyène ne put se retenir. Quand le choix lui fut proposé entre les deux calebasses, l'hyène, que le petit génie n'avait pas mise en garde volontairement, choisit la plus grande.Une fois dans sa case, après en avoir soigneusement clos les sept portes, l'hyène prononça la formule magique qu'on lui avait confiée : « Changement de changement ! » La calebasse s'ouvrit. Il en sortit un martinet en peau de bœuf qui la flagella furieusement. L'hyène courut affolée dans sa case, brisa à demi ses portes en tentant sans succès de les ouvrir. Enfin lorsque la septième porte céda, elle se précipita au-dehors, toujours poursuivie par la cravache.C'est depuis lors que l'hyène ne se soucie plus de chercher des parures pour sa femme et ne s'occupe plus que de ses propres affaires. Le baobab est l'arbre typique de l'Afrique tropicale. C'est l'emblème du Sénégal. Pour beaucoup de cultures africaines, le baobab est sacré : il est considéré comme un lieu traditionnel de rassemblement à l'ombre duquel on discute des problèmes du village, de politique… on y fait également la sieste ! Le baobab a une drôle d'allure : son écorce ressemble à la peau d'un vieil éléphant ! Avec ses fines branches tordues, il a l'air de pousser à l'envers !Le baobab produit des fruits au goût acidulé qui plaisent autant aux hommes qu'aux singes ! Leurs pulpes sont utilisées pour en faire un jus appelé bouye ou jus de pain de singe.  Quels sont les deux animaux, héros de l'histoire ?  Comment le lièvre rencontre-t-il le génie des eaux ?  Combien de temps le lièvre reste-t-il dans le village aquatique ?  L'écorce du baobab ressemble à la peau :    L'hyène vint un jour trouver le lièvre et lui dit : « Allons chercher des ceintures de verroterie pour nos femmes. »L'hyène ramassa des graines de karité, les traversa d'un fil et donna sept ceintures de cette sorte à sa femelle.Le lièvre, lui, passa trois jours dans la brousse sans trouver ce qu'il désirait. Enfin, las de cette recherche vaine, il vint se reposer sous un baobab. « Ah ! s'écria-t-il, que l'ombre de cet arbre est donc agréable ! — Goûte de mes feuilles ! répondit le baobab. Elles te seront plus agréables encore que mon ombre ! » Le lièvre cueillit une feuille et la mangea.« C'est vrai, dit-il. C'est délicieux ! — Mon fruit est encore meilleur au goût ! — Si je pouvais en avoir beaucoup, j'en ferais commerce et je deviendrais très riche ! déclara le lièvre.— C'est donc la richesse que tu cherches ?— Oui.— Eh bien ! vois à l'intérieur », dit l'arbre dont le tronc s'ouvrit alors. Le lièvre regarda et vit de l'or, des colliers, des bijoux, des vêtements somptueux, des richesses de toute sorte. Il tendit la patte vers toutes ces choses désirables.« Attends un peu ! conseilla le baobab. Ce n'est pas ici que tu trouveras ce qu'il te faut. Va dans le champ de tomates : tu y rencontreras celui qui te donnera tout ce que tu peux souhaiter. »  Le lièvre passa dans le champ voisin. Il y trouva un petit génie des eaux en train de manger des tomates. Quand celui-ci l'aperçut, il lui cria : « Ne me tue pas ! Je sais pourquoi tu viens ici et je peux te procurer ce que tu cherches. Accompagne-moi dans les profondeurs du marais, mais garde-toi bien de rire de ce qui se passera sous tes yeux.« D'abord, mon père reviendra du pâturage. Il voudra poser sa houlette contre le mur, mais ce sera le bâton qui saisira mon père et le placera contre ce même mur. « De même, lorsque ma mère rentrera, portant un fagot qu'elle voudra jeter à terre, c'est elle-même que tu verras rudement jetée sur le sol par le fagot.« Ensuite, ma mère tuera une poule à ton attention, mais elle t'en apportera les plumes rôties au lieu de la viande. Mange les plumes comme s'il n'y avait rien de plus naturel. »Le lièvre promit d'obéir en tout point. Le petit génie le mena alors au fond du fleuve et tout se passa comme prévu. Le lièvre passa sept jours en compagnie de ses nouveaux amis. Le matin du septième jour, le chef du village aquatique sortit de sa case. « Notre chef va convoquer tout son peuple, dit le petit génie au lièvre. On te présentera deux calebasses. Prends la plus petite des deux.— C'est bien compris ! » répondit le lièvre. Et en effet, il choisit la plus petite des calebasses qu'on lui donna à choisir. On lui recommanda de ne l'ouvrir qu'une fois rendu chez lui. Le lendemain matin, les génies le firent sortir du fleuve sans qu'il eût un seul poil de mouillé.Il rentra chez lui et ouvrit alors seulement la calebasse. Elle renfermait des trésors de toute sorte, en quantité. Il en fit cadeau à sa femme. Lorsque celle-ci parut au puits, couverte de bijoux, la femme de l'hyène en ressentit une si furieuse jalousie que, de rage, elle cassa les fils des ceintures que son mari lui avait offertes. Elle rentra au plus vite au logis et apostropha celui-ci : « Tu n'es bon à rien ! lui cria-t-elle. La femme du lièvre a de belles ceintures d'or et les miennes sont faites de graines d'arbre ! Si tu ne m'en apportes pas de pareilles, je m'en retournerai chez mon père et tu ne me reverras plus ! »L'hyène prit alors un morceau de charbon. « Je saurai bien, dit-elle, où le lièvre s'est procuré tout cela ! » Elle alla se poster en gémissant derrière la case du malin compère. Celui-ci vint s'informer de la cause de ces cris. « Ah ! geignit l'hyène, depuis une semaine j'ai des rages de dents ; un abcès s'est formé et maintenant le pus, cessant de couler, s'est durci. Toi qui es plus adroit que moi, tu dois pouvoir me le retirer. — Comment puis-je être sûr que tu n'en profiteras pas pour manger ma patte ? s'inquiéta le lièvre.— Voyons, comment un malade pourrait-il manger celui qui l'a guéri ? »Rassuré, le lièvre entreprit alors de soigner l'hyène. Il introduisit sa patte dans la gueule de l'hyène qui aussitôt referma ses mâchoires. « Je ne ferai qu'une bouchée de ta patte, si tu ne me dis pas où tu as trouvé tous les cadeaux que tu as faits à ta femme. — C'est d'accord ! » répondit immédiatement le lièvre tout tremblant. Le lièvre mena alors l'hyène sous le baobab et l'arbre lui parla comme il avait fait au lièvre. L'hyène se rendit dans le champ de tomates et commença par brutaliser le petit génie. Celui-ci la prévint alors de rester impassible devant les spectacles qui lui inspireraient la plus forte envie de rire, mais l'hyène ne put se retenir. Quand le choix lui fut proposé entre les deux calebasses, l'hyène, que le petit génie n'avait pas mise en garde volontairement, choisit la plus grande.Une fois dans sa case, après en avoir soigneusement clos les sept portes, l'hyène prononça la formule magique qu'on lui avait confiée : « Changement de changement ! » La calebasse s'ouvrit. Il en sortit un martinet en peau de bœuf qui la flagella furieusement. L'hyène courut affolée dans sa case, brisa à demi ses portes en tentant sans succès de les ouvrir. Enfin lorsque la septième porte céda, elle se précipita au-dehors, toujours poursuivie par la cravache.C'est depuis lors que l'hyène ne se soucie plus de chercher des parures pour sa femme et ne s'occupe plus que de ses propres affaires.\n",

      "  Il était un village dans lequel vivaient trois frères. L'aîné prit son arc et ses flèches, et s'en alla chasser. Il s'installa près d'un fleuve dans lequel vivaient des poissons. Il banda son arc, et une flèche toucha un poisson que le frère plaça sous une pierre. Le poisson était vivant, mais il ne pouvait plus bouger, car la pierre le retenait. Le frère avançait toujours, et à chaque fois la même scène se répétait : il attrapait des poissons et les mettait sous une pierre. Mais une fois, la flèche atterrit dans une racine d'arbre. De la racine s'écoula un liquide blanc. Le frère se dit :« C'est ainsi que pleure l'arbre à pain. » Il vit que celui-ci portait plus de fruits que de feuilles. Le frère déposa son arc et ses flèches et grimpa à l'arbre. Il prit une branche recourbée pour faire tomber les fruits. L'un d'eux tomba sur le toit d'une cabane qu'il n'avait pas vue et qui se dissimulait sous l'arbre. Une femme, Bouma, sortit de la cahute. Elle avait de vilains yeux, et tout le monde avait peur d'elle. Elle volait les enfants des gens du village. Elle cria au frère : « Qui touche à mon arbre à pain ? »Le frère tremblait tout comme la branche qu'il tenait, mais il répondit :« C'est moi et mes frères.— Appelle-les, dit Bouma.— Frères ! » appela-t-il.Et tous les poissons, qui étaient retenus par des pierres pour ne pas se sauver, répondirent. Bien que Bouma fût en colère, elle dit :« Bon. Cueillez donc ! Les fruits sont à moi et à vous. »  Le frère descendit de l'arbre, enveloppa ses fruits, prit son arc et ses flèches, et retourna au fleuve. Il continua à attraper des poissons, puis il les enleva de dessous les pierres et les enveloppa dans une grande feuille. Alors, il rentra chez lui. Il fit cuire sur le feu les fruits de l'arbre à pain et les poissons, et il mangea. Ses frères, attirés par l'odeur, salivèrent en voyant les poissons et les fruits de l'arbre à pain.« Nous avons faim. Donne-nous au moins les peaux, demandèrent-ils.— Ce qui est à moi est à moi » dit le frère aîné, et il mangea tout, tout seul. Quand le soleil monta à l'horizon, le frère cadet prit son arc et ses flèches, et s'en alla. Il alla vers le fleuve, et avec son arc et une flèche, il prit un poisson. Il le mit dans le fleuve, sous une pierre. Alors qu'il avait déjà attrapé beaucoup de poissons, une des flèches se ficha dans une racine, et la racine pleura. Le frère vit alors beaucoup de fruits sur l'arbre à pain. Il se réjouit et se dit : « C'est à cet arbre que s'est nourri mon frère ! » Il déposa à terre son arc et ses flèches, brisa une branche recourbée, et fit tomber des fruits. Les fruits s'abattirent sur la cabane de Bouma, qui sortit et dit :« Qui donc maraude encore dans mon arbre à pain ?— C'est moi et mes frères.— Appelle-les, dit Bouma. Le frère appela, les poissons répondirent, et Bouma dit aussitôt :— Fort bien. Cueillez donc ! Les fruits sont à moi et à vous. »  Le frère cadet descendit de l'arbre, ramassa les fruits et les enveloppa dans un grand baluchon. Il chercha les poissons, les emballa dans une grande feuille et s'en alla. À la maison, il fit un grand feu et mangea. Ses frères humaient le parfum et mouraient d'envie de manger. Ils dirent :« Donne-nous au moins ces petits poissons, nous avons faim.— Ce qui est à moi est à moi » dit le frère cadet, et il mangea tout, tout seul. Le lendemain, le benjamin prit son arc et ses flèches, et se mit en route. Il trouva les traces de la veille, qui le conduisirent près du fleuve. Le frère prit son arc et une flèche et attrapa un poisson. Le frère le tua, coupa une liane et y attacha le poisson. Déjà, il avait une longue ligne de poissons. Il s'enfonça profondément dans la forêt. Malencontreusement, une flèche se ficha dans une racine. La racine pleura. À l'instar de ses frères, il regarda les branches et se dit : « C'est à cet arbre que se sont nourris mes frères ! Il y a énormément de fruits, et ils ne m'en ont même pas donné un ! »  Il déposa à terre son arc et ses flèches, brisa une branche recourbée, grimpa à l'arbre et fit tomber des fruits. Les fruits s'abattirent sur le toit de la cabane. Bouma sortit, très en colère, et elle cria :« Qui est-ce qui maraude encore les fruits de mon arbre à pain ? » Le plus jeune des trois frères, mort de peur, répondit :— Moi et mes frères.— Appelle-les, dit Bouma.— Frères ! » appela-t-il. Mais les poissons étaient morts, et pas une seule voix ne se fit entendre.Bouma dit : « Appelle encore ! »Il appela, si bien qu'un fruit de plus tomba, mais aucune voix ne se fit entendre.Bouma dit :« Tu mens, tu es tout seul ici. Quand tu descendras, je te mangerai. Par où vas-tu descendre ?— Par ta cabane. »Vite, Bouma arracha le toit et le rejeta au loin.Elle dit : « Je te tiens. Par où descends-tu ?— Par les poutres de ta cabane. » dit le frère.Vite, Bouma arracha les poutres, les brisa et éparpilla les morceaux loin de l'arbre à pain. Puis elle déterra les pieux qui soutenaient la charpente, et la cabane s'écroula.Le frère dit : « Je vais descendre par ce cocotier. »Bouma abattit le palmier et tous les arbres qui, autour de l'arbre à pain, lui fournissaient sa nourriture. Elle dit : « Par où vas-tu descendre, maintenant ? »Le frère répondit : « Par ce porc, qui passe par là. »Bouma saisit sa hache et tua le cochon.Le frère dit, intentionnellement : « Par ton chien qui accourt par ici. »Bouma tua le chien.Elle dit : « Maintenant je te tiens. Comment descendras-tu désormais ? »Le frère dit : « Par ta jambe gauche. »Bouma se la coupa et tomba à terre.Le frère dit : « Par ta main droite. »Bouma se coupa la main droite. Le frère descendit de l'arbre, prit son arc et une flèche, et tua Bouma. Il ramassa les fruits de l'arbre à pain, les emballa dans un gros baluchon qu'il jeta sur son épaule. Il prit aussi la liane avec les poissons attachés et rentra chez lui.Ses frères l'attendaient, car déjà le soir tombait. Le benjamin raconta ses aventures. Tous étaient bien contents, ils chantèrent et mangèrent sa nourriture autour du feu.  Depuis ce jour, Bouma n'a plus jamais emporté d'enfants du village. La Terre est divisée en cinq continents séparés nettement les uns des autres. Il s'agit de grandes étendues de terre entourées d'eau regroupant plusieurs pays.

      "  Il y avait, dans un village qui existe d'ailleurs toujours, un pauvre homme qui avait beaucoup travaillé durant de longues années. Ce bonhomme avait des enfants et, souvent, pas un morceau de pain au logis. Volontiers, s'il en avait eu la possibilité, il aurait participé, d'une quelconque manière, à l'édification de l'église. En voyant passer les riches du pays avec leurs voitures et leurs charrues chargées de pierres pour bâtir le lieu saint, le pauvre hère se disait : « Que vais-je faire, misérable que je suis, moi qui n'ai ni voiture ni charrue ? »Or, l'idée lui vint de prendre sa hotte et de porter des pierres pour ériger l'église, dans la nuit, pendant que tous dormaient. Et ainsi fit-il. Comme il travaillait de la sorte, un petit vieux s'approcha de lui et lui dit :« Que faites-vous si tard ici, l'ami ?— Ah, dit l'homme, je n'ai ni voiture ni charrue, et j'aimerais pourtant apporter ma contribution à la construction de l'église ; aussi, je prends ma hotte, et je porte des pierres pendant que tout le monde dort. » Alors le petit homme lui dit : « Eh bien, cette peine ne restera pas sans récompense, je t'accorde le pouvoir de faire trois souhaits. »  Le pauvre homme réfléchit un instant, et répondit : « En ce cas, je désire, quand je mourrai, le ciel et la vie éternelle ; pour cette vie, je m'accommoderais du vieux bahut qui est dans le grenier, s'il pouvait se trouver rempli d'or sans se vider jamais. Autrement, je n'ai besoin de rien. Le ciel et de l'argent, cela me suffit.— Prends garde, reprit le petit homme, ta maison est une bicoque et s'écroulera bientôt ; qui sait si tu vivras assez longtemps pour en bâtir une autre ? Fais encore un souhait.— Eh bien, alors, dit le bonhomme, je désire que ma maison devienne une fois plus grande.— Tout cela te sera accordé » dit le petit homme, et il disparut. Lorsque l'artisan arriva devant sa demeure, il vit que l'ancienne avait été remplacée par une autre, une fois plus grande. Le vieux bahut se trouvait comblé d'or et s'emplissait de nouveau quand il était vide. Notre homme vécut désormais tranquille et content et, dans son bonheur, il n'oublia ni les églises ni les pauvres. Ce qui s'était passé ne resta pas ignoré dans le village ; tout le monde en parlait. C'est ainsi que cela parvint aux oreilles d'un homme riche, un affreux avare, qui avait beaucoup de biens, mais cependant jamais assez. « Si j'avais la même chance ! » se dit-il. Et, prenant une hotte, il apporta des pierres pour bâtir l'église, pendant que tout le monde dormait. Bientôt le petit vieillard survint et dit :« Hé, l'ami ! que faites-vous si tard ici ?— J'apporte des pierres, répliqua le riche, pendant que tout le monde se repose et dort.— Alors, tu auras le pouvoir de former trois souhaits » lui dit le petit homme.Le riche y avait réfléchi d'avance et répondit :« Je souhaite deux yeux vifs et clairs à mon vieux cheval ; quant aux deux autres souhaits, j'en réserve l'honneur à ma femme.— Eh bien, dit le petit homme, vos souhaits s'accompliront. »  Lorsque l'avare fut de retour au logis, il alla tout de suite à l'écurie. Son vieux cheval s'y trouvait avec des yeux clairs et vifs. Puis, il entra dans sa maison et dit à sa femme : « J'avais trois souhaits en mon pouvoir. Le premier est fait, mon cheval a des yeux clairs et vifs ; mais c'est toi, femme, qui aura l'honneur de former les deux autres souhaits. » Mais la femme se fâcha et dit : « Si tu as souhaité pareille chose, je voudrais, vieux fou, que tu fusses borgne comme était ton cheval ! » À peine eut-elle prononcé ces mots, que son mari devint borgne comme l'était le vieux cheval, autrefois. L'avare fut pris d'une telle fureur qu'il exprima le troisième vœu en criant à sa femme : « Si tu ne sais souhaiter que cela, pauvre sotte, je voudrais te voir aveugle ! » Ainsi fut fait, et ce fut là leur récompense. Au Moyen Âge, chaque ville ou village possède son église. Sa construction peut durer plusieurs années et même parfois toute une vie ! L'église occupe une place centrale dans la vie des hommes. De nombreux événements comme les baptêmes, les mariages ou les fêtes (Noël, Pâques) y sont célébrés. Les prêtres participent aussi à la vie quotidienne en aidant les plus démunis : distribution de nourriture ; accueil des plus pauvres ; soin des malades.   En contrepartie, chaque paysan paye au clergé un impôt que l'on appelle la « dîme ». Cette taxe correspond à un dixième de leur récolte. Cathédrale de Chartres. Saviez-vous que la France est l'un des pays qui possède le plus grand nombre d'églises ? On en compte environ 40 000 sur tout le territoire. Quel est le premier vœu du pauvre homme ?  Dans l'histoire, un « bahut » est :  Un « avare » est un homme qui :  L'avare donne ses deux derniers vœux :  À la fin de l'histoire, l'avare, devenu borgne, rend sa femme :  La France compte environ :    Il y avait, dans un village qui existe d'ailleurs toujours, un pauvre homme qui avait beaucoup travaillé durant de longues années.

L'avare fut pris d'une telle fureur qu'il exprima le troisième vœu en criant à sa femme : « Si tu ne sais souhaiter que cela, pauvre sotte, je voudrais te voir aveugle ! » Ainsi fut fait, et ce fut là leur récompense.\n",

      "  Deux sœurs vivaient ensemble ; l'aînée était très belle et la cadette très laide. La belle était courtisée par tous les jeunes hommes des environs, et celle qui était laide n'attirait même pas le regard des vieillards. Et pourtant, la vilaine avait un cœur en or, et la belle était méchante et prétentieuse. Ainsi va le monde !   Un soir, la jeune fille laide se dit : « Ici, rien de bon ne m'attend. Je construirai une maison à la montagne et j'y vivrai seule. Plus personne ne verra mon visage ni ne se moquera de moi. »Au petit matin, elle quitta le village et se dirigea vers la montagne. La jeune fille marcha toute la journée, et ses jambes étaient fatiguées lorsqu'elle aperçut enfin un filet de fumée s'élever au-dessus de la vallée. Elle s'approcha et vit, assise devant une jolie petite maison, une vieille femme aveugle. Elle avait des nattes grises, mais ses lèvres étaient d'un rouge éclatant et ses dents brillaient comme des diamants. Plus étonnant encore, elle avait deux visages, l'un devant et l'autre derrière. « C'est sûrement une sorcière », pensa la jeune fille.  Néanmoins, elle la salua très poliment et s'enquit de sa santé. « Je me porte bien, merci, répondit la sorcière. Seuls mes yeux ne voient plus comme avant. C'est pourquoi je cherche une servante. Ne voudrais-tu pas travailler pour moi ? Tu auras un bon salaire et à manger autant que tu voudras.— Pourquoi pas, répondit la jeune fille en se disant : \"Je serai bien ici et les yeux aveugles ne verront pas ma laideur.\" » La jeune fille laide travailla donc chez la sorcière et s'en trouva bien. Tous les jours, elle ajoutait une pièce d'or dans un petit coffret et elle mangeait à satiété. La sorcière lui avait même donné une jolie robe. La jeune fille la méritait bien, car elle servait sa maîtresse loyalement, ne profitant pas du fait que la vieille femme était aveugle. Elle balayait la poussière et raccommodait le linge avec de tout petits points. Le temps passa et une année s'écoula. « Ton service chez moi se termine, dit un jour la sorcière à la jeune fille. Tu peux à présent rentrer chez toi.— Oh non ! s'écria-t-elle. Je veux rester ici. Toi, tu ne vois pas la laideur de mon visage, tu ne connais que le son de ma voix et le travail de mes mains. Mais les autres se moquent de moi. Je ne veux plus jamais les revoir !— Tu as un visage ingrat, mais un cœur en or, répondit la sorcière. Mes yeux paraissent aveugles, mais ils voient beaucoup mieux que ceux des autres. N'as-tu pas remarqué que j'en ai quatre ? Quand deux dorment, les deux autres restent éveillés. Je connais ton visage depuis le jour où tu es arrivée et, en vérité, il m'importe peu qu'il soit beau ou laid. Mais cela semble vital pour toi et c'est pourquoi j'ai décidé de t'aider. À présent, entre dans la maison et touche le miroir qui est contre le mur. » La jeune fille fit comme la vieille femme lui avait dit. La tête baissée – pour éviter de voir son visage – elle tendit la main vers le miroir. Soudain, celui-ci s'ouvrit comme une porte, et derrière lui une autre pièce apparut. Sur les murs, il y avait des centaines de visages ! « Vas-y, choisis celui qui te plaît ! » commanda la sorcière. La jeune fille, émerveillée, regarda attentivement tous ces innombrables visages, et finit par en choisir un, gentil et souriant, avec de grands yeux. Dès qu'elle l'eut désigné, la sorcière prit le visage de la jeune fille dans ses mains et le suspendit au mur. Puis elle posa sur sa tête le nouveau visage. Comme elle était belle à présent ! « Rentre chez toi et vis en paix ! » lui dit la sorcière. Puis elle tendit à la jeune fille son coffret en clamant : « Double est ma face, que double soit ton contenu ! » Aussitôt dit, aussitôt fait, le coffret fut immédiatement rempli de pièces d'or. La jeune fille remercia la sorcière et lui fit ses adieux. Puis elle rentra chez elle en courant. Elle était heureuse, belle et riche, que demander de plus !  Sa sœur aînée n'arriva pas à en croire ses yeux ; elle ne reconnut sa cadette qu'au son de sa voix. Mais ce changement ne lui plut guère, car la laide était maintenant plus belle qu'elle. « Moi aussi, j'irai dans la montagne », se dit-elle quand elle eut appris comment sa sœur avait réussi. Si la sorcière avait su rendre si beau le visage si laid de sa sœur, le sien, déjà si gracieux, deviendrait le plus beau du monde. Puis, sans tarder, la sœur aînée prit la route. Elle marcha toute la journée et commençait à être fatiguée lorsqu'elle vit un filet de fumée s'élever au-dessus de la vallée. Elle s'y dirigea et arriva près d'une jolie maisonnette devant laquelle était assise une vieille femme aveugle. Elle avait des nattes grises, mais ses lèvres étaient d'un rouge éclatant et ses dents brillaient comme des diamants. Plus étonnant encore, elle avait deux visages, l'un devant et l'autre derrière.« C'est la sorcière ! » pensa la jeune fille. Elle fit une grimace désobligeante – puisque la vieille femme ne voyait rien – puis, d'une voix mielleuse, elle s'enquit de sa santé. Et la sorcière la prit à son service, tout comme sa sœur. La belle jeune fille fit semblant de travailler. Tantôt elle faisait un peu de bruit en remuant quelques objets, tantôt elle donnait de petits coups de balai, mais elle passait le plus clair de son temps devant la glace à s'admirer. La poussière s'accumula bientôt dans tous les coins de la maisonnette et le linge fut raccommodé très grossièrement. Néanmoins, tous les jours, la jeune fille mangeait à volonté et elle recevait également une pièce d'or, qu'elle rangeait dans son coffret. Ainsi, une année passa.« Ton service chez moi touche à sa fin, dit un jour la sorcière. À présent, tu peux rentrer chez toi.— Oh non ! objecta la jeune fille. Je ne veux rentrer qu'avec un nouveau visage !— C'est ce que tu veux ? Entre donc dans la maison et touche le miroir », répondit la sorcière. La jeune fille se dépêcha de rentrer, tendit la main, et le miroir s'ouvrit comme une porte. Derrière lui, il y avait une autre pièce où d'innombrables visages étaient accrochés aux murs. « Ferme les yeux et ne les ouvre pas avant que je ne te le dise », ordonna la sorcière. Puis elle prit la tête de la jeune fille dans ses mains, ôta son joli visage et le suspendit au mur. Elle posa ensuite sur la tête de la jeune fille le visage de sa sœur cadette.Puis elle lui tendit son petit coffret, après y avoir jeté de la poussière ramassée dans un coin de la pièce et avoir dit : « Double est ma face, que double soit ton contenu ! » Elle conduisit ensuite la jeune fille devant la maison et lui dit : « Tu peux ouvrir les yeux à présent et rentrer chez toi. »  La jeune fille ne dit ni au revoir ni merci et descendit la colline en courant, pressée qu'elle était de rentrer au village. Vous pouvez aisément imaginer ce qu'elle ressentit quand elle se vit dans un miroir et qu'elle entendit les quolibets des voisins. Lorsqu'elle ouvrit le coffret, un nuage de poussière s'en échappa et se déposa sur ses cheveux. Elle ne réussit plus jamais à les démêler… Elle fut si honteuse que, très vite, elle quitta le village. Personne ne sut où ses jambes l'avaient guidée, et plus jamais dans la région on n'entendit parler d'elle. Sa sœur cadette épousa un homme beau et aimable, et ils vécurent heureux et en paix. Certes, le beau visage de la jeune femme allait vieillir un jour, mais « un cœur bon le reste toute une vie ».  Les visages peuvent être très différents les uns des autres, mais ils sont tous formés de la même manière : deux yeux, deux oreilles, un nez et une bouche.Certaines personnes ont des fossettes qui se creusent sur les joues quand elles rient, d'autres ont des tâches de rousseur, d'autres encore ont des grains de beauté.  Que signifie le mot « ingrat » ?  La sorcière a un handicap, elle est :  Pour accéder à la pièce pleine de visages, la jeune fille touche :  La sœur cadette a un cœur :  Pourquoi l'aînée va-t-elle aussi voir la sorcière ?  Combien de temps chacune des sœurs reste-t-elle chez la sorcière ?  Qu'est-ce qu'un « quolibet » ?  Qui a les cheveux bruns et bouclés, les yeux verts, une petite moustache et un grain de beauté sur le front ?  Qu'est-ce qui change de couleur quand on vieillit ?    Deux sœurs vivaient ensemble ; l'aînée était très belle et la cadette très laide. La belle était courtisée par tous les jeunes hommes des environs, et celle qui était laide n'attirait même pas le regard des vieillards. Et pourtant, la vilaine avait un cœur en or, et la belle était méchante et prétentieuse. Ainsi va le monde !   Un soir, la jeune fille laide se dit : « Ici, rien de bon ne m'attend. Je construirai une maison à la montagne et j'y vivrai seule. Plus personne ne verra mon visage ni ne se moquera de moi. »Au petit matin, elle quitta le village et se dirigea vers la montagne. La jeune fille marcha toute la journée, et ses jambes étaient fatiguées lorsqu'elle aperçut enfin un filet de fumée s'élever au-dessus de la vallée. Elle s'approcha et vit, assise devant une jolie petite maison, une vieille femme aveugle. Elle avait des nattes grises, mais ses lèvres étaient d'un rouge éclatant et ses dents brillaient comme des diamants.

Ne voudrais-tu pas travailler pour moi ? Tu auras un bon salaire et à manger autant que tu voudras.— Pourquoi pas, répondit la jeune fille en se disant : \"Je serai bien ici et les yeux aveugles ne verront pas ma laideur.\" » La jeune fille laide travailla donc chez la sorcière et s'en trouva bien.

      "  Un jour, un brahmine traversait un village de l'Inde. Il faut savoir qu'un brahmine est un Hindou qui ne fait jamais de mal aux animaux, et qui les traite en frères. Donc, un jour, le brahmine traversait un village lorsqu'il vit sur le bord de la route une grande cage de bambou, et dans cette cage, il y avait un énorme tigre, que les villageois avaient pris dans un piège et enfermé là pour le vendre à une ménagerie, parce qu'il dévorait tous leurs moutons.« Frère brahmine, frère brahmine, dit le tigre, ouvre la porte et laisse-moi sortir un peu pour aller boire. J'ai tellement soif, et il n'y a pas d'eau dans ma cage.— Mais, frère tigre, dit le brahmine, si j'ouvre la porte, tu me sauteras dessus et tu me mangeras ?— Que vas-tu penser là ? demanda le tigre. Jamais de la vie je ne ferais une chose pareille ! Fais-moi sortir juste une petite minute, pour chercher une goutte d'eau, frère brahmine ! »Le brahmine ouvrit la porte de la cage et laissa sortir le tigre, mais, dès que celui-ci fut dehors, il sauta sur le brahmine pour le manger. « Frère tigre, dit le pauvre brahmine, tu m'as promis de ne pas me manger, ce que tu fais là n'est ni honnête ni juste !— Au contraire, c'est tout à fait honnête et juste, dit le tigre, et quand bien même il en serait autrement, ça m'est égal. Je vais te manger. » Mais le brahmine supplia tellement le tigre que celui-ci finit par consentir à attendre jusqu'à ce qu'ils eussent consulté les cinq premières personnes qu'ils rencontreraient. La première chose qu'ils virent sur le bord du chemin fut un grand figuier banian.« Frère banian, dit le brahmine, est-il juste et honnête que le tigre veuille me manger après que je l'ai fait sortir de sa cage ? » Le figuier banian les regarda, et dit d'une voix lasse : « Pendant l'été, quand le soleil est brûlant, les hommes viennent s'abriter à mon ombre et se rafraîchissent avec mes fruits mais, quand le soir vient et qu'ils sont reposés, ils cassent mes branches et éparpillent mes feuilles. L'homme est une race ingrate. Que le tigre mange le brahmine. »Le tigre sauta sur le brahmine, mais celui-ci cria : « Pas encore ! pas encore ! Nous n'en avons vu qu'un ! Il y en a encore quatre à consulter. » Un peu plus loin, ils virent un buffle couché en travers du chemin. Le brahmine s'arrêta et lui dit : « Frère buffle, oh ! frère buffle, est-ce qu'il te semble honnête et juste que ce tigre veuille me manger, quand je viens juste de le faire sortir de sa cage ? » Le buffle les regarda, et dit d'une voix basse et profonde : « Quand j'étais jeune et fort, mon maître me faisait travailler dur, et je le servais bien. Je portais de lourds fardeaux, et je traînais de grandes charrettes. Maintenant que je suis vieux et faible, il me laisse sans eau et sans nourriture pour que je meure sur le chemin. Les hommes sont ingrats. Que le tigre mange le brahmine. »Le tigre fit un bond, mais le brahmine dit très vite : « Oh ! mais, ce n'est que le deuxième, frère tigre, et tu m'en as accordé cinq ! » Le tigre grommela beaucoup, mais consentit à aller un peu plus loin. Bientôt, ils virent un aigle planant au-dessus de leurs têtes, et le brahmine l'implora : « Oh ! frère aigle, frère aigle ! Dis-nous s'il te semble juste que ce tigre veuille me manger, après que je l'ai délivré d'une terrible cage ? » L'aigle continua à planer lentement pendant quelques instants, puis il descendit et parla d'une voix claire : « Je vis dans les nuages, et je ne fais aucun mal aux hommes. Cependant, toutes les fois qu'ils peuvent trouver mon aire, ils tuent mes enfants et me lancent des flèches. Les hommes sont une race cruelle. Que le tigre mange le brahmine. » Le tigre sauta de nouveau, et le brahmine eut bien de la peine à le persuader d'attendre encore. Il y consentit pourtant et ils continuèrent leur chemin. Un peu plus loin, ils virent un vieux crocodile, à demi enterré dans la vase, près de la rivière. « Frère crocodile, frère crocodile, dit le brahmine, est-ce que vraiment il te semble juste que ce tigre veuille me manger, alors que je l'ai délivré de sa cage ? » Le vieux crocodile se retourna dans la vase, et grogna, et souffla, après quoi, il dit, de sa voix éraillée : « Je reste tout le jour couché dans la vase, aussi innocent qu'une colombe. Je ne chasse pas les hommes, et pourtant, toutes les fois qu'un homme me voit, il me jette des pierres et me pique avec des bâtons pointus, en m'insultant. Les hommes ne valent rien. Que le tigre mange le brahmine.— En voilà assez, dit le tigre, tu vois bien qu'ils sont tous du même avis. Allons !— Mais il en manque un, frère tigre, dit le pauvre brahmine, plus qu'un, le cinquième ! Le tigre finit par consentir, bien malgré lui. Bientôt ils rencontrèrent un petit chacal, trottant gaiement sur la route. « Oh ! frère chacal, frère chacal, dit le brahmine, dis-nous ce que tu penses ! Est-ce que vraiment tu trouves juste que ce tigre veuille me manger, après que je l'ai délivré de sa cage ?— Plaît-il ? demanda le petit chacal.— Je dis, répéta le brahmine en élevant la voix, crois-tu qu'il soit juste que ce tigre me mange, quand c'est moi qui l'ai fait sortir de sa cage ?— Cage ? répéta le petit chacal d'un ton distrait.— Oui, oui, sa cage, dit le brahmine. Nous voulons connaître ton avis. Penses-tu…— Oh ! dit le petit chacal. Vous voulez avoir mon avis ? Alors, je vous prierai de parler bien distinctement, car je suis quelquefois assez lent à comprendre. De quoi s'agit-il ?— Penses-tu, dit le brahmine, qu'il soit juste que ce tigre veuille me manger, quand c'est moi qui l'ai fait sortir de sa cage ?— Quelle cage ? demanda le petit chacal.— Celle où il était, dit le brahmine. Tu vois bien…— Mais je ne comprends pas bien, interrompit le petit chacal. Tu dis que tu l'as délivré ?— Oui, oui, oui, dit le brahmine. C'est arrivé comme ça : je marchais le long de la route, et je vis le tigre…— Oh ! ma tête ! dit le petit chacal. Je ne pourrai jamais rien comprendre, si tu commences une si longue histoire. Il faut parler plus clairement. Quelle sorte de cage ?— Une grande cage ordinaire, dit le brahmine, une cage en bambou.— Ça ne me dit rien du tout, fit le petit chacal. Vous feriez mieux de me montrer la chose, alors, je comprendrai tout de suite. » Ils rebroussèrent chemin et arrivèrent à l'endroit où se trouvait la cage.  « À présent, voyons un peu, dit le petit chacal. Frère brahmine, où étais-tu placé ?— Juste ici, sur la route, dit le brahmine.— Tigre, où étais-tu ? dit le petit chacal.— Eh bien ! dans la cage, naturellement, dit le tigre, qui commençait à s'impatienter, et qui avait bien envie de les manger tous les deux.— Oh ! je vous demande pardon, monseigneur, dit le petit chacal. Je suis vraiment bien peu intelligent. Je ne peux pas me rendre compte. Si vous vouliez bien… Comment étiez-vous dans cette cage ? Dans quelle position ?— Idiot ! Comme cela ! dit le tigre, en sautant dans la cage ; là, dans ce coin, avec la tête tournée de côté.— Oh ! merci, merci, dit le petit chacal. Je commence à y voir clair, mais, il y a encore une chose, pourquoi y restiez-vous ?— Ne peux-tu pas comprendre que la porte était fermée ? hurla le tigre.— Ah ! la porte était fermée ? Je ne comprends pas très bien. La… porte… était… fermée ?… Comment était-elle fermée ?— Comme cela, dit le brahmine en poussant la porte.— Ah ! comme cela ? Très bien, dit le petit chacal. Mais, je ne vois pas de serrure. Ce n'est pas très solide. Pourquoi le tigre ne pouvait-il pas sortir ?— Parce qu'il y a un verrou, dit le brahmine en poussant le verrou.— Ah ! il y a un verrou ? dit le petit chacal. Vraiment ? Il y a un verrou ? Eh bien ! Mon bon ami, dit-il au brahmine, maintenant que le verrou est poussé, je vous conseille de le laisser comme il est. Et pour vous, monseigneur, continua-t-il en s'adressant au tigre, plein de fureur, je crois qu'il se passera un certain temps avant que vous ne trouviez quelqu'un d'autre pour vous ouvrir. »Et, se tournant vers le brahmine, il lui fit un profond salut.« Adieu, frère, dit-il. Votre chemin va par ici, et le mien va par là. Bonne journée ! » Dans la folie des villesLes klaxons des voitures et des bus bondés, les moteurs pétaradants des mobylettes et des rickshaws (moto-taxis), les cris des vendeurs : les grandes villes indiennes sont étourdissantes ! Dans la foule, on remarque la beauté des indiennes, drapées dans leurs saris (grands tissus) aux couleurs vives. Aux pays des rajahsAu Rajasthan, les forteresses, les palais et les temples rappellent la grandeur des rajahs, anciens rois de la région. Chaque ville a sa couleur. Udaipur est blanche. Dans ses ruelles étroites et pentues, des singes sautent sur les toits. Blanche également, la petite ville de Pushkar attire chaque année une grande foire aux chameaux. Jodhpur est toute bleue : cette couleur est censée repousser les insectes. On surnomme Jaipur la « ville rose » : ses bâtiments ont été construits en pierre rose ou peints de la même couleur. Jaisalmer se cache au fin fond du désert. Sur les étendues de sable se dresse sa citadelle aux tons beige. Au bord du GangeVaranasi (ou Bénarès) s'étend au bord du Gange, le grand fleuve sacré de l'Inde. Cette vieille ville est la plus sainte du pays. D'immenses escaliers, les « ghats », descendent dans l'eau. Dès le lever du soleil, des milliers de personne arrivent de tout le pays. Elles viennent se baigner et boire cette eau sacrée. Elles y déposent ensuite des grains de riz, des pétales de fleurs ou des bananes pour les dieux. Puis elles prient en silence, dans la fumée des bougies et des bâtons d'encens. À leurs côtés, les vaches continuent leur petit bonhomme de chemin, dévorant les poubelles… ou les étalages des marchands ! Elles se promènent en liberté et les Indiens les laissent faire ce qu'elles veulent : pour eux, la vache est un animal sacré.  Qu'est-ce qu'un brahmine ?  Combien d'avis le brahmine a-t-il le droit de demander avant que le tigre ne le mange ?  Quel animal défend finalement le brahmine ?  Que reprochent les animaux aux Hommes ?  À la fin de l'histoire, qu'arrive-t-il au tigre ?    Un jour, un brahmine traversait un village de l'Inde. Il faut savoir qu'un brahmine est un Hindou qui ne fait jamais de mal aux animaux, et qui les traite en frères. Donc, un jour, le brahmine traversait un village lorsqu'il vit sur le bord de la route une grande cage de bambou, et dans cette cage, il y avait un énorme tigre, que les villageois avaient pris dans un piège et enfermé là pour le vendre à une ménagerie, parce qu'il dévorait tous leurs moutons.« Frère brahmine, frère brahmine, dit le tigre, ouvre la porte et laisse-moi sortir un peu pour aller boire.

Le brahmine s'arrêta et lui dit : « Frère buffle, oh ! frère buffle, est-ce qu'il te semble honnête et juste que ce tigre veuille me manger, quand je viens juste de le faire sortir de sa cage ? » Le buffle les regarda, et dit d'une voix basse et profonde : « Quand j'étais jeune et fort, mon maître me faisait travailler dur, et je le servais bien. Je portais de lourds fardeaux, et je traînais de grandes charrettes. Maintenant que je suis vieux et faible, il me laisse sans eau et sans nourriture pour que je meure sur le chemin. Les hommes sont ingrats. Que le tigre mange le brahmine. »Le tigre fit un bond, mais le brahmine dit très vite : « Oh ! mais, ce n'est que le deuxième, frère tigre, et tu m'en as accordé cinq ! » Le tigre grommela beaucoup, mais consentit à aller un peu plus loin. Bientôt, ils virent un aigle planant au-dessus de leurs têtes, et le brahmine l'implora : « Oh ! frère aigle, frère aigle ! Dis-nous s'il te semble juste que ce tigre veuille me manger, après que je l'ai délivré d'une terrible cage ? » L'aigle continua à planer lentement pendant quelques instants, puis il descendit et parla d'une voix claire : « Je vis dans les nuages, et je ne fais aucun mal aux hommes. Cependant, toutes les fois qu'ils peuvent trouver mon aire, ils tuent mes enfants et me lancent des flèches. Les hommes sont une race cruelle. Que le tigre mange le brahmine. » Le tigre sauta de nouveau, et le brahmine eut bien de la peine à le persuader d'attendre encore. Il y consentit pourtant et ils continuèrent leur chemin. Un peu plus loin, ils virent un vieux crocodile, à demi enterré dans la vase, près de la rivière. « Frère crocodile, frère crocodile, dit le brahmine, est-ce que vraiment il te semble juste que ce tigre veuille me manger, alors que je l'ai délivré de sa cage ? » Le vieux crocodile se retourna dans la vase, et grogna, et souffla, après quoi, il dit, de sa voix éraillée : « Je reste tout le jour couché dans la vase, aussi innocent qu'une colombe. Je ne chasse pas les hommes, et pourtant, toutes les fois qu'un homme me voit, il me jette des pierres et me pique avec des bâtons pointus, en m'insultant. Les hommes ne valent rien. Que le tigre mange le brahmine.— En voilà assez, dit le tigre, tu vois bien qu'ils sont tous du même avis. Allons !— Mais il en manque un, frère tigre, dit le pauvre brahmine, plus qu'un, le cinquième ! Le tigre finit par consentir, bien malgré lui. Bientôt ils rencontrèrent un petit chacal, trottant gaiement sur la route. « Oh ! frère chacal, frère chacal, dit le brahmine, dis-nous ce que tu penses ! Est-ce que vraiment tu trouves juste que ce tigre veuille me manger, après que je l'ai délivré de sa cage ?— Plaît-il ? demanda le petit chacal.— Je dis, répéta le brahmine en élevant la voix, crois-tu qu'il soit juste que ce tigre me mange, quand c'est moi qui l'ai fait sortir de sa cage ?— Cage ? répéta le petit chacal d'un ton distrait.— Oui, oui, sa cage, dit le brahmine. Nous voulons connaître ton avis. Penses-tu…— Oh ! dit le petit chacal. Vous voulez avoir mon avis ? Alors, je vous prierai de parler bien distinctement, car je suis quelquefois assez lent à comprendre. De quoi s'agit-il ?— Penses-tu, dit le brahmine, qu'il soit juste que ce tigre veuille me manger, quand c'est moi qui l'ai fait sortir de sa cage ?— Quelle cage ? demanda le petit chacal.— Celle où il était, dit le brahmine. Tu vois bien…— Mais je ne comprends pas bien, interrompit le petit chacal. Tu dis que tu l'as délivré ?— Oui, oui, oui, dit le brahmine. C'est arrivé comme ça : je marchais le long de la route, et je vis le tigre…— Oh ! ma tête ! dit le petit chacal. Je ne pourrai jamais rien comprendre, si tu commences une si longue histoire. Il faut parler plus clairement. Quelle sorte de cage ?— Une grande cage ordinaire, dit le brahmine, une cage en bambou.— Ça ne me dit rien du tout, fit le petit chacal. Vous feriez mieux de me montrer la chose, alors, je comprendrai tout de suite. » Ils rebroussèrent chemin et arrivèrent à l'endroit où se trouvait la cage.  « À présent, voyons un peu, dit le petit chacal. Frère brahmine, où étais-tu placé ?— Juste ici, sur la route, dit le brahmine.— Tigre, où étais-tu ? dit le petit chacal.— Eh bien ! dans la cage, naturellement, dit le tigre, qui commençait à s'impatienter, et qui avait bien envie de les manger tous les deux.— Oh ! je vous demande pardon, monseigneur, dit le petit chacal. Je suis vraiment bien peu intelligent. Je ne peux pas me rendre compte. Si vous vouliez bien… Comment étiez-vous dans cette cage ? Dans quelle position ?— Idiot ! Comme cela ! dit le tigre, en sautant dans la cage ; là, dans ce coin, avec la tête tournée de côté.— Oh ! merci, merci, dit le petit chacal. Je commence à y voir clair, mais, il y a encore une chose, pourquoi y restiez-vous ?— Ne peux-tu pas comprendre que la porte était fermée ? hurla le tigre.— Ah ! la porte était fermée ? Je ne comprends pas très bien. La… porte… était… fermée ?… Comment était-elle fermée ?— Comme cela, dit le brahmine en poussant la porte.— Ah ! comme cela ? Très bien, dit le petit chacal. Mais, je ne vois pas de serrure. Ce n'est pas très solide. Pourquoi le tigre ne pouvait-il pas sortir ?— Parce qu'il y a un verrou, dit le brahmine en poussant le verrou.— Ah ! il y a un verrou ? dit le petit chacal. Vraiment ? Il y a un verrou ? Eh bien ! Mon bon ami, dit-il au brahmine, maintenant que le verrou est poussé, je vous conseille de le laisser comme il est. Et pour vous, monseigneur, continua-t-il en s'adressant au tigre, plein de fureur, je crois qu'il se passera un certain temps avant que vous ne trouviez quelqu'un d'autre pour vous ouvrir. »Et, se tournant vers le brahmine, il lui fit un profond salut.« Adieu, frère, dit-il. Votre chemin va par ici, et le mien va par là. Bonne journée ! »\n",

      "  Un père de famille, à sa mort, laissa deux orphelins : un fils, Daouda, et une fille, Aïssata. Cette dernière était si jolie que son frère craignit que le roi ne la lui enlevât de force. Aussi construisit-il, dans son champ même, une case où il la logea pour la soustraire à sa vue. Il cessa lui-même d'habiter le village, et vécut près d'Aïssata pour la protéger, si besoin était. Un jour que Douada chassait l'éléphant, un bouvier se présenta à la porte de la case et demanda à boire. L'orpheline lui apporta de l'eau. Après avoir bu, le bouvier dit à la jeune fille : « Tu es vraiment jolie ! Si tu y consens, je te prendrai comme femme et je te donnerai cent taureaux en dot.— Éloigne-toi bien vite, répondit Aïssata, mon frère ne saurait tarder. S'il te rencontrait ici, tu serais un homme mort. » Le bouvier prit au sérieux l'avertissement et s'enfuit sans même s'occuper de son troupeau qui paissait près du champ de mil des orphelins. Une fois rentré au village, il courut trouver le roi et lui dit : « Seigneur, je sais où vit une jeune fille d'une beauté sans égale et je puis te l'amener, à condition que tu me donnes des hommes pour l'enlever, car elle est gardée par son frère, qui est d'une extrême cruauté. » Le roi fit escorter le bouvier par trente cavaliers, qu'il guida vers la case de Daouda. Quand la petite troupe fut à peu de distance, le bouvier se rappela la menace de vengeance que lui avait faite Aïssata. La peur le reprit. Il s'arrêta net et s'adressa à son escorte : « Encerclez cette case. C'est là que se trouve la jolie fille que nous devons ramener au roi. Quant à moi, je m'en vais à la recherche de mon troupeau, qui s'est égaré ce matin. » Les cavaliers chevauchèrent vers la case. Aïssata, qui les voyait venir de loin, appela son frère en lui criant : « Voici des cavaliers qui viennent m'enlever ! » Daouda cessa aussitôt son travail, rentra dans la case prendre ses armes et, revenant, l'arc tendu et le carquois à l'épaule, dit à sa sœur : « Je vais les tuer tous, à l'exception d'un seul, qui ira annoncer la mort de ses compagnons à celui qui les a envoyés ici. » Les cavaliers étaient maintenant proches de la case. Ils poussaient des cris aigus pour épouvanter le défenseur d'Aïssata, mais Daouda avait commencé à décocher ses flèches, dont chacune traversait de trois à quatre cavaliers. Il abattit ainsi vingt-neuf hommes et n'épargna que le dernier, qui s'enfuit et alla prévenir son maître du désastre. Le roi, exaspéré, ordonna à cent cavaliers et à cent guerriers à pied d'aller s'emparer de la jeune fille. De tous ces hommes, il n'en revint qu'un au village. Les autres avaient été tués par Daouda. Successivement, le seigneur envoya plusieurs colonnes qui furent, les unes après les autres, anéanties par l'orphelin. Un jour, une vieille vint trouver le seigneur. « Tu gaspilles tes guerriers sans résultat, dit-elle. Si tu me promets un présent de valeur, dès demain tu auras en ton pouvoir la jolie fille, sœur de celui qui a tué plus de la moitié de tes guerriers.— Trouve le moyen de me ramener cette jeune fille, déclara le seigneur, et ton fils aura pour femme une de mes filles. » La vieille salua le roi et s'en revint chez elle, où elle fit bouillir une plante soporifique, puis, après avoir retiré les feuilles de cette décoction, elle y délaya de la farine de mil. Avec cette pâte légère, elle prépara des galettes. La vieille prit alors le sentier qui menait au champ des orphelins et, tout en marchant, elle criait : « Galettes ! Qui veut acheter de bonnes galettes ? » Daouda, qui n'avait pas goûté de ces galettes depuis son départ du village, héla la vieille, lui en acheta deux et les dévora à belles dents. Il n'avait pas sitôt fini de mâcher la dernière bouchée qu'il tomba à terre, profondément endormi. La vieille ne perdit pas de temps. Elle courut prévenir le seigneur qu'il pouvait sans crainte envoyer prendre Aïssata par deux hommes seulement, car son défenseur ne se réveillerait pas avant le lendemain.  Le roi dépêcha deux hommes avec ordre de se saisir de l'orpheline. Quand Aïssata les aperçut, elle secoua son frère. « Réveille-toi ! Deux hommes viennent pour s'emparer de moi !— Passe-moi mon carquois et mon arc ! » balbutia Daouda, sans faire le moindre mouvement, tant il était engourdi par le sommeil. Les cavaliers s'emparèrent d'Aïssata et l'amenèrent chez le roi, qui l'épousa. Quand Daouda reprit ses esprits et qu'il s'aperçut de la disparition de sa sœur, il devint à moitié fou de rage. Il s'enfonça dans la forêt, ne voulant plus voir d'êtres humains. Il y vécut, chassant avec les génies des bois ; il mangeait et dormait en leur compagnie. Il était devenu tout à fait sauvage ; des arbustes, des herbes, lui poussaient sur la tête.  Un jour que, fatigué de marcher, il s'était étendu sous un arbre, des bûcherons l'aperçurent. Ils se jetèrent sur lui, le ligotèrent et l'entraînèrent au village, où ils le livrèrent au roi. Le seigneur fit couper les herbes et les arbustes qui lui poussaient sur la tête  ; on le rasa complètement. Ensuite, on le donna à Aïssata pour qu'il garde l'enfant qu'elle avait eu du roi. Aïssata ne reconnut pas son frère en ce captif, alors que Daouda avait su tout de suite que la femme qui se tenait devant lui était sa sœur. Il prit l'enfant dans ses bras et chanta : « Ô, mon neveu, amuse-toi ! Fils de celle que j'ai nourrie avec le lait des vaches de notre père, amuse-toi ! »Aïssata, en l'entendant, se mit à pousser des cris. Le seigneur, inquiet, accourut aussitôt. « Seigneur ! dit-elle, tu as fait de mon frère ton captif et tu me l'as donné pour garder mon fils ! » Le roi demanda à Daouda si Aïssata disait la vérité. Celui-ci alors raconta toute son histoire. Quand son récit toucha à sa fin, son beau-frère lui donna de l'or et de l'argent en quantité, des bijoux, des chevaux, des vaches, et lui abandonna tout pouvoir sur la moitié du village. Par la suite, il lui confia une armée à commander, car Daouda avait prouvé, aux dépens même du roi, qu'il était brave et qu'il tirait adroitement à l'arc.   150 g de semoule de maïs   2 œufs   2 cuillères à soupe d'huile d'olive   1/4 de litre d'eau     une pincée de sel   une poêle   • Avec l'aide d'un adulte, verse la semoule de maïs dans un grand saladier. Casse les deux œufs sans laisser de coquilles. Ajoute l'huile d'olive, le sel et l'eau. • Mélange bien pour que la pâte soit lisse sans grumeaux et laisse reposer pendant une heure.  • Demande à un adulte de faire cuire les galettes des deux côtés dans une poêle très chaude, comme pour des crêpes.  • Pour rendre les galettes croustillantes, demande à un adulte de les passer au four à 120° C pendant 10 minutes. Les galettes sont prêtes !  Comment s'appellent les deux orphelins ?  Pour convaincre Aïssata de l'épouser, le bouvier lui propose :  Pour défendre sa sœur, Daouda se munit d'un arc et d'un :  Daouda s'endort après avoir mangé :  Après l'enlèvement de sa sœur, Daouda se réfugie dans :  Sur la tête de Daouda, il pousse :  Le seigneur récompense Daouda, car il :    Un père de famille, à sa mort, laissa deux orphelins : un fils, Daouda, et une fille, Aïssata. Cette dernière était si jolie que son frère craignit que le roi ne la lui enlevât de force. Aussi construisit-il, dans son champ même, une case où il la logea pour la soustraire à sa vue.

      "  Il était une fois, dans une région lointaine du Viêt Nam, un jeune paysan, brave et généreux, prénommé Ngoc Tâm. Il avait une femme très belle et très élégante. Contrairement à son mari, qui était économe et laborieux, elle était paresseuse et adorait le luxe. Malgré cela, Ngoc Tâm aimait son épouse et lui pardonnait tout. Malheureusement, cette union ne fut que de courte durée, car la jeune femme mourut brutalement un beau matin. Désespéré, Ngoc Tâm ne voulut pas se séparer du corps de son épouse et s'opposa à son ensevelissement. Après avoir vendu ses biens, il s'embarqua avec le cercueil dans un petit bateau à voile, un sampan, et erra au gré du courant, n'ayant en tête aucune destination précise. Un jour, son sampan l'amena au pied d'une colline verdoyante et parfumée. Descendu à terre, il découvrit un paysage d'une grande beauté avec des fleurs rares et des arbres chargés de fruits variés. Il rencontra soudain un vieillard à la barbiche et aux longs cheveux blancs. Il se dégageait du vieil homme une grande sérénité et une miséricorde étonnante. Ngoc Tâm comprit qu'il avait devant lui un génie des lieux. Il se jeta à ses pieds, l'implorant de rendre la vie à sa femme. Pris de pitié, le génie lui dit : « Je vais exaucer tes vœux, car ton amour et ta douleur sont sincères. Mais puisses-tu ne pas le regretter plus tard ! » Puis il demanda au paysan d'ouvrir le cercueil, de se couper le bout du doigt et de laisser tomber trois gouttes de sang sur le corps de la défunte. Aussitôt, celle-ci ouvrit les yeux comme si elle sortait d'un long sommeil. Avant de partir, le génie s'adressa à la femme : « N'oublie pas tes devoirs d'épouse. Pense à l'amour que ton époux te porte et à son dévouement. Soyez heureux tous deux. »  Pressé de regagner son foyer, Ngoc Tâm rama jour et nuit. Un soir, il dut accoster pour aller acheter des provisions. Pendant son absence, la grande barque d'un riche marchand vint s'amarrer à côté de la sienne. Frappé par la beauté de la jeune femme, le marchand entra en conversation avec elle, finit par la séduire et par l'emmener avec lui vers une nouvelle destination. À son retour, Ngoc Tâm, furieux, décida de se lancer à la poursuite du riche marchand. Il parvint à retrouver ce dernier après de longs mois de recherche. Il retrouva également sa femme et lui proposa de le rejoindre. Habituée à la vie luxueuse que lui offrait le marchand, celle-ci refusa. D'un coup, le paysan fut guéri de son amour et dit à sa femme : « Tu es libre de me quitter. Mais tu dois me rendre les trois gouttes de sang que j'ai versées sur ton corps pour te ranimer. » Heureuse de se débarrasser à si bon compte de son stupide mari, elle s'empressa de se piquer le doigt. Mais au moment où le sang commença à couler, elle s'écroula morte. Toutefois, elle ne pouvait pas se résigner à quitter définitivement ce monde. Elle y revint transformée en un minuscule insecte poursuivant sans relâche Ngoc Tâm, pour lui voler les trois gouttes de sang qui la ramèneraient à la vie humaine. C'est cet insecte que l'on appelle « moustique ».  Comment l'identifier ?  Taille : entre 3 et 6 mm. Couleur : gris. Particularité : le moustique, appelé également cousin, n'a qu'une paire d'ailes. Chez la femelle, la trompe qui sert à l'alimentation est un tube renfermant six stylets perforants.    HabitatOn peut rencontrer des moustiques dans presque tous les milieux et sur tous les continents. Ils apprécient tout particulièrement les zones humides. Mode de vieLes moustiques sont plutôt actifs la nuit. Seules les femelles piquent la peau pour se nourrir de sang. Cette consommation de sang favorise la ponte des œufs qui se forment plus vite. Les larves sont aquatiques.Les mâles se nourrissent avec le jus des fruits et le suc des plantes.  Dans quel pays l'histoire se déroule-t-elle ?  Quel est le métier de Ngoc Tâm ?  Un beau matin, la femme de Ngoc Tâm meurt brutalement.  Le vieil homme sur la colline est :  Pour ressusciter sa femme, Ngoc Tâm doit :  Pour retrouver sa liberté, la femme de Ngoc Tâm doit lui rendre :  La femme de Ngoc Tâm revient transformée en :    Il était une fois, dans une région lointaine du Viêt Nam, un jeune paysan, brave et généreux, prénommé Ngoc Tâm.

      "L'Odyssée d'Ulysse est une épopée écrite par Homère, poète grec de la fin du viiie siècle avant J.-C. Considéré comme un véritable chef-d'œuvre, L'Odyssée est, avec L'Iliade, (du même auteur), le poème fondateur de la civilisation européenne. L'Odyssée raconte le laborieux retour d'Ulysse, roi d'Ithaque, chez les siens. Parti en guerre, il mit plus de vingt ans à retrouver son royaume, son peuple et surtout sa femme Pénélope, ainsi que son fils Télémaque. En chemin, Ulysse fit de nombreuses rencontres (les Cyclopes, Minos, les Sirènes, la sorcière Circé, etc.) qui sont autant d'histoires merveilleuses. Quel est l'auteur de l'Odyssée ?  Quel est le prénom de l'épouse d'Ulysse ?  Après quelle guerre Ulysse traverse ses aventures ?  Quel personnage a emprisonné Ulysse dans une grotte enchantée ?

      "  Sur une île vivait Milad, pauvre femme qui ne possédait qu'un petit lopin de terre. Chaque jour, elle cultivait et soignait le taro qui lui fournissait toute sa nourriture. Un matin qu'elle allait à son champ, elle aperçut un œuf dans une touffe de broussailles. Elle le ramassa et l'examina de tous les côtés. Comme elle le tenait en main, elle le réchauffa, et l'œuf grossit. Milad le rapporta chez elle, car ses mains et sa tête lui disaient que ce n'était pas un œuf d'oiseau, mais du Soleil, que c'était le Soleil qui l'avait pondu afin qu'elle en ait un enfant. Elle l'installa dans une corbeille encore plus douillettement qu'une mère l'aurait fait pour son petit, car Milad n'avait pas d'enfants.  Trois jours passèrent, et l'enfant du Soleil sortit de l'œuf. Elle l'installa au-dessus du feu pour qu'il pousse vite. Il poussa, poussa, comme une tige de bambou, et bientôt il devint un gamin du nom de Terkelel, puis très vite un adolescent.Le jeune homme demanda un jour à Milad :« Maman, chaque jour nous mangeons la même nourriture, des taros et encore des taros, et toujours des taros, pourquoi n'y a-t-il pas autre chose ? – Je suis pauvre, mon fils, je suis une femme qui n'a qu'un petit lopin de terre. Je n'ai pas d'autre nourriture, je n'ai même pas de mari qui pourrait aller pêcher. » Terkelel se promena le long du rivage et chercha parmi les coquillages celui qui lui dirait comment aider Milad. Il trouva soudain ce qu'il cherchait, mais pas parmi les coquillages. Terkelel plongea dans la mer et nagea, nagea, très, très loin. Puis il plongea, la tête la première et s'enfonça, s'enfonça, jusqu'à arriver profondément sous l'île. Comme un ver, il remonta en perçant la terre de toute l'île et déboucha sous l'arbre à pain qui ombrageait la cabane de sa mère. Il fora d'abord son tronc, puis ses branches, et tandis qu'il avançait ainsi, derrière lui jaillissait l'eau de la mer, entraînant avec elle les poissons. Ils nageaient dans les creux de l'arbre et des branches, puis retombaient devant la maison de Milad. Maintenant la femme et le jeune Terkelel avaient du poisson à ne plus savoir qu'en faire. Ils en avaient tant qu'ils en donnaient aux gens qui n'avaient pas assez à manger. Le poisson était abondant.  Mais sur l'île vivaient des gens qui ne supportaient pas le bonheur des autres. Leur cœur était rempli de jalousie. Une nuit, ils prirent des haches, allèrent vers l'arbre à pain de Milad et en coupèrent une grosse branche. Dès que celle-ci tomba, l'eau de mer se transforma en cascade, elle coula à gros flots, se répandit, et bientôt l'île entière fut sous les eaux. La mer avait avalé l'île comme une plage à marée haute, et avec l'île tous les gens qui y vivaient. Seul le fils du Soleil, Terkelel, resta au-dessus des eaux, il vola plus haut, vers le Soleil. Milad avait d'abord nagé, puis elle avait crié. Et elle était morte. Terkelel monta jusqu'au ciel, dans sa tête résonnaient les cris de Milad, sa mère. Il se dit : « Je vais demander au roi du ciel de lui rendre la vie. Quand il fut tout près des cieux, il vit se dresser sur sa route l'homme de pierre, le gardien des lieux. Dès que celui-ci surprenait quelqu'un sur le chemin de la voûte céleste, il avertissait les gens dans le ciel. Il sifflait comme un cyclone, car l'air passait à travers ses lèvres de pierre. Terkelel arracha des feuilles de pandanus et y enveloppa l'homme de pierre. Puis il l'emporta. Il arriva au ciel et se présenta devant son roi.Il lui dit : « Roi du ciel, donne-moi la force vitale, afin que je puisse l'insuffler à Milad, qui est morte. Elle était ma mère, et je ne veux pas qu'elle flotte sur la mer et ne me parle plus. »Le roi du ciel lui donna la pierre de vie.Puis il dit : « Si tu poses la pierre sur le corps d'un homme, cet homme sera immortel. » Terkelel prit la pierre, et s'en alla au-dessus de la mer, où flottait le corps de Milad. Il y déposa dessus la pierre, et Milad fut de nouveau vivante. Puis ils nagèrent rapidement vers l'île, où ils vécurent ensemble comme mère et fils. Pendant ce temps, le roi du ciel demandait où était l'homme de pierre, car il y avait longtemps qu'il ne l'avait plus entendu siffler. Il envoya ses sept esprits, et ils constatèrent que l'homme de pierre avait disparu. Où ? ils l'ignoraient. Ils se présentèrent devant le roi, qui leur dit : « Eh bien faites ce qu'il faut pour le retrouver. Où qu'il soit, allez vite le chercher et rapportez-le-moi. Celui qui l'a volé sera puni. » Les esprits descendirent sur l'île dans la mer, ils cherchèrent sur la terre ferme, ils cherchèrent sur l'eau, mais ils ne trouvèrent pas l'homme de pierre. Ils pénétrèrent à l'intérieur de l'île, arpentèrentle rivage, toujours rien. Finalement, ils entrèrent dans un bois touffu, et ils virent l'homme de pierre. Il était caché par des feuilles d'arbres. Les esprits le laissèrent là. Ils voulaient d'abord retrouver et punir le voleur. Soudain ils arrivèrent devant la cabane où habitaient Milad et Terkelel, le fils du Soleil. Les esprits s'approchèrent de la femme et dirent : « L'homme de pierre est là, dans le bois, derrière ta cabane. Qui a fait cela ? Qui l'a apporté du ciel pour le planter dans le bois ? » Milad tremblait comme un arbre quand il sent le souffle de la tempête.Puis elle dit :« C'est mon fils Terkelel qui l'a apporté.– Amène-le ici. La punition l'attend au pays du ciel ! » Milad entra dans sa cabane. Elle avait des tranches de taro fraîchement cuites, elle les farcit de poisson. Dans le taro brûlant, le poisson avait bouilli, et un parfum puissant et délicieux monta jusqu'au plafond. Puis Milad sortit devant la cabane et donna du taro farci de poisson à chacun des sept esprits. Ils ne connaissaient pas cette nourriture, jamais ils n'y avaient goûté. Ils la trouvèrent extraordinaire et dirent qu'ils n'avaient rien mangé d'aussi bon.Quand ils eurent fini, Milad leur dit : « C'est mon fils Terkelel qui a apporté l'homme de pierre, mais seulement pour ne pas pleurer ma mort. Il s'est rendu au ciel, puis il a ranimé mon corps qui était mort. » Les esprits ne dirent rien, trop occupés par le souvenir de la bonne nourriture. Ensuite, ils s'envolèrent vers le ciel avec l'homme de pierre, et le châtiment se noya dans la mer. L'homme de pierre se dressa de nouveau dans les hauteurs, il siffla et fit hurler le vent. Il mena la garde du ciel.  Dans le conte, Terkelel naît d'un œuf ! Chez les êtres humains, cela se passe différemment…Mais pour de nombreux animaux comme le serpent, la tortue ou la poule, les petits sortent d'un œuf pondu par la mère. Ce sont des ovipares.  L'œuf se développe dans le corps de la mère, puis elle le dépose :  dans l'eau (chez les amphibiens, les poissons et les mollusques) ; dans ou sur la terre (c'est le cas pour les reptiles et de nombreux insectes) ; dans les arbres (pour les oiseaux).    Selon les espèces, le mâle ou la femelle couvent l'œuf Cette période s'appelle l'incubation. Elle dure plus ou moins longtemps Ainsi, la poule couve pendant 21 jours, le mâle pingouin une soixantaine de jours !Ensuite, le bébé casse la coquille et sort : c'est l'éclosion.  Que trouve Milad dans une touffe de broussailles ?  Terkelel monte au ciel voir le Roi, car ce dernier :  Le chemin de la voûte céleste est gardé par :  Pour ramener Milad à la vie, le Roi du ciel donne à Terkelel :  Que donne Milad à manger aux sept esprits ?  Quel est l'intrus ?    Sur une île vivait Milad, pauvre femme qui ne possédait qu'un petit lopin de terre. Chaque jour, elle cultivait et soignait le taro qui lui fournissait toute sa nourriture. Un matin qu'elle allait à son champ, elle aperçut un œuf dans une touffe de broussailles. Elle le ramassa et l'examina de tous les côtés.

      "  L'oiseau vint dire à la poule : « Poule, tu as des ailes, pourquoi ne peux-tu pas prendre ton envol comme je le fais ?— Parce que je n'en suis pas capable », répondit la poule. L'oiseau reprit : « Pourquoi parler ainsi ? Tu as des pattes, des ailes comme les miennes et tout ce qui est dans mon corps est aussi dans le tien. »Lorsque la poule l'entendit, vexée, elle se fâcha et ne voulut plus écouter les paroles de l'oiseau : « Va-t'en, dit-elle, coucher dans le désert, laisse-moi dormir dans la maison ; je n'apprécie pas le langage que tu m'as tenu.— Puisque tu ne veux pas entendre mes paroles, continua l'oiseau, demain les gens te prendront, te tueront et mangeront ta chair. Tu n'as pas d'intelligence : alors que je viens t'apprendre la sagesse, tu me repousses ! Bientôt, lorsque tu verras les gens venir pour te tuer, peut-être alors m'écouteras-tu. » La poule répondit : « Va-t'en, je n'ai que faire de toi.— Très bien », dit l'oiseau en partant se percher sur un arbre. Dès l'aurore, le maître de maison se leva et saisit un bâton pour tuer la poule. À sa vue, celle-ci prit son vol, traversa la maison de son maître en poussant des plaintes : « Ce que l'oiseau m'avait prédit hier est arrivé, alors que j'ai refusé de l'écouter ! »L'oiseau, toujours perché sur son arbre, dit à la poule : « Entre dans les herbes : si ton maître te voit, il te tuera.

En le voyant partir, la poule sortit des herbes pour rejoindre l'oiseau. Celui-ci lui donna de nouveaux conseils : « S'il vient pour te tuer, ponds un œuf. Quand il le verra, il pensera : la poule pond des œufs, je ne la tuerai pas. Mais il prendra l'œuf, s'en ira le faire cuire avec du sel, le mangera et sera content. Chaque matin, il viendra chercher à l'endroit où tu pondras un œuf. Voilà le conseil que je te donne, ne l'oublie pas.— Je te remercie, mon frère, répondit la poule, je ferai ce que tu m'as recommandé, aujourd'hui, demain, jusqu'à ma mort.

      "  Taqqiq était un jeune garçon inuit, connu dans la région pour sa beauté mais aussi pour sa cécité : en effet, il était devenu aveugle très tôt. Il vivait avec sa petite sœur, Siqiniq. Celle-ci, malgré son jeune âge, savait déjà entretenir la lampe à huile, préparer les peaux et coudre des vêtements chauds et résistants. À la mort de leurs parents, ils avaient été recueillis par leur grand-mère, une vieille femme colérique et méchante, qui estimait que Taqqiq, aveugle, n'était qu'une bouche inutile.Ils habitaient tous les trois sous un iglou qui, en ce début de printemps ensoleillé, commençait à fondre et menaçait de s'écrouler. Déjà, le sommet gouttelait sur leurs têtes et les parois scintillaient de mille perles d'eau. Une nuit, alors qu'ils dormaient profondément, pelotonnés dans une peau de caribou sur la plate-forme de l'iglou, ils furent réveillés en sursaut par un grognement effrayant. Taqqiq reconnut aussitôt ce bruit : c'était celui de l'ours. Il fallait réagir très vite. La grand-mère attrapa l'arc et la flèche posés près de ses bottes et les donna à Taqqiq :« Prends cet arc et cette flèche. C'est l'occasion de tuer ton premier ours. Je vais t'aider à viser, tu n'auras qu'à te laisser guider. »Ainsi fut dit, ainsi fut fait. Le craquement de la glace retentit sous le poids de l'ours, tombé raide mort. Un large sourire illumina le visage de Taqqiq. Aussi fut-il surpris quand sa grand-mère lui dit, feignant d'être très en colère :« Idiot ! C'est le chien que tu as tué ! Non seulement tu as manqué une proie superbe, mais en plus, tu nous prives de notre meilleur chien de traîneau. Tu n'es vraiment qu'un bon à rien ! »La grand-mère voulait garder la peau et la viande de l'ours pour elle toute seule. Elle rêvait déjà du pantalon qu'elle pourrait se coudre dans cette grande peau blanche, moelleuse et si chaude. Elle tua le chien et fit cuire sa chair. À chaque repas, elle servait ainsi de la viande de chien à Taqqiq, pendant qu'elle mangeait l'ours avec Siqiniq.Un soir, Siqiniq réussit à cacher de la viande d'ours sous sa parka et l'offrit en cachette à son frère :« Tiens, Taqqiq, voilà de la bonne viande d'ours ! »Taqqiq eut ainsi la preuve qu'il avait bien tué l'ours et que sa grand-mère était une menteuse, égoïste de surcroît. Il décida de se venger.« Petite sœur, pourrais-tu me guider jusqu'aux falaises, demain matin ?— Bien sûr, grand frère. » Le lendemain matin, Siqiniq accompagna Taqqiq près du rivage. Le paysage était magnifique et Siqiniq regrettait que son frère ne puisse pas le voir. Les falaises se reflétaient dans l'eau de la mer. Les derniers blocs de banquise dérivaient doucement le long de la côte. Quelques oiseaux s'y posaient de temps à autre. D'autres plongeaient à pic des sommets rocheux vers la mer, dans un brouhaha joyeux de cris auxquels les falaises répondaient en écho. Taqqiq percevait cette effervescence autour de lui et aurait été tellement heureux de voir enfin le soleil qui réchauffait son visage et les oiseaux qui piaillaient dans les falaises.« Merci, petite sœur, de m'avoir accompagné jusqu'ici. Laisse-moi seul maintenant. Tu peux rentrer au campement.— Mais comment feras-tu pour revenir ?— Je me débrouillerai. Ne t'inquiète pas. »Siqiniq prit le chemin du retour, laissant son frère seul, assis sur un rocher. Quand Siqiniq eut disparu derrière la colline, Taqqiq appela le plongeon arctique qu'il sentait voler tout près de lui :« Bonjour, plongeon. Les aînés disent que tu as des pouvoirs et que tu peux redonner la vue. Est-ce vrai ?— Oui, c'est vrai. Mais cela exige beaucoup de courage.— Je suis prêt. »Le plongeon prit Taqqiq entre ses pattes et le plongea une première fois dans l'eau glacée de la mer. Taqqiq ressortit immédiatement la tête de l'eau : le froid lui brûlait les tempes. Il reprit ses esprits et découvrit qu'il percevait un peu de lumière.Mais aussitôt, l'oiseau lui replongea la tête sous l'eau. Cette fois, Taqqiq réussit à rester un peu plus longtemps immergé, en apnée. Et quand il remonta pour respirer, il vit des formes, autour de lui.Une troisième fois, l'oiseau lui plongea la tête dans l'eau tellement longtemps que Taqqiq eut peur de se noyer. Lorsque le plongeon lâcha prise, le garçon revint enfin à la surface. Il put alors distinguer les oisillons qui prenaient leur premier envol, tout en haut, au sommet des falaises.Ébloui par tout ce qu'il découvrait, il remercia le plongeon et prit le chemin du campement. Il était si heureux qu'il sautillait d'un rocher à l'autre. Lui qui avait toujours marché prudemment, à tâtons pour ne pas tomber, il pouvait maintenant jouer comme les autres enfants.À l'approche de l'iglou, il ralentit son allure et reprit sa démarche hésitante. Personne ne devait savoir qu'il voyait de nouveau. La vie reprit son cours normal. La grand-mère continuait de brimer Taqqiq et celui-ci se demandait comment se venger. L'occasion rêvée arriva bientôt.Un matin, Taqqiq fut réveillé brutalement par sa grand-mère :« Dépêche-toi flemmard ! Tu n'entends pas tout ce bruit autour de toi ? Les bélugas sont arrivés ! Il ne faut pas rater cette occasion ! Enfile ton pantalon et ta parka, et prends le harpon. Nous partons ! Espérons que nous pourrons au moins en attraper un petit… »Quand ils arrivèrent sur la plage, la grand-mère enroula la corde du harpon autour de ses hanches :« Je vais t'aider à hisser le béluga hors de l'eau quand tu l'auras harponné. Mais comme je ne suis pas assez forte pour retenir un béluga adulte, il faut que tu en harponnes un petit. Laisse moi guider ton bras vers le jeune béluga que j'aperçois là-bas. Voilà. Tire maintenant ! »Mais plutôt que de choisir la petite baleine, Taqqiq lança son harpon vers un énorme mâle. La pointe se ficha solidement dans la chair de l'animal, qui, sous l'effet de la douleur, se mit à nager encore plus vite. La grand-mère n'eut pas le temps de se dégager de la lanière du harpon. Entraînée par le béluga, elle tomba dans la mer et fut emportée au loin, dans le sillage de l'animal.Le jeune garçon lui cria : « Toi qui as gardé la viande de l'ours pour toi seule, garde aussi celle-ci ! »La vieille femme réapparaissait de temps en temps à la surface et, avant qu'elle disparaisse définitivement, les enfants eurent juste le temps de voir ses cheveux se torsader et se figer en une longue défense d'ivoire.C'est ainsi que la méchante grand-mère s'est transformée en narval.  Les Inuits sont un peuple amérindien originaire du Canada et du Groenland. La population est dispersée tout autour du cercle arctique.  Les iglousAutrefois, les Inuits se servaient d'iglous comme abris temporaires pendant la chasse.Les iglous sont des sortes de maison en forme de dôme fabriquées avec des blocs de neige et de glace.Les briques de neige empilées permettent d'isoler les iglous qui sont alors confortables et insonorisés. Si à l'extérieur la température est de − 40° C, à l'intérieur il ne fait que − 5° C ! Aujourd'hui les Inuits vivent dans des maisons en bois et ne se servent presque plus d'iglous.   Taqqiq et sa famille vivent dans :  Quelle est la particularité de Taqqiq ?  Avec son arc, Taqqiq tire une flèche sur :  La grand-mère fait croire à Taqqiq qu'il a chassé :  Le béluga ressemble à :  Les Inuits sont un peuple amérindien originaire du Canada et  :  Pour se protéger du froid les Inuits portent :  Dans quel type d'habitation les Inuits vivent-ils aujourd'hui ?  Quels sont les animaux chassés par les Inuits ?    Taqqiq était un jeune garçon inuit, connu dans la région pour sa beauté mais aussi pour sa cécité : en effet, il était devenu aveugle très tôt. Il vivait avec sa petite sœur, Siqiniq. Celle-ci, malgré son jeune âge, savait déjà entretenir la lampe à huile, préparer les peaux et coudre des vêtements chauds et résistants. À la mort de leurs parents, ils avaient été recueillis par leur grand-mère, une vieille femme colérique et méchante, qui estimait que Taqqiq, aveugle, n'était qu'une bouche inutile.Ils habitaient tous les trois sous un iglou qui, en ce début de printemps ensoleillé, commençait à fondre et menaçait de s'écrouler. Déjà, le sommet gouttelait sur leurs têtes et les parois scintillaient de mille perles d'eau. Une nuit, alors qu'ils dormaient profondément, pelotonnés dans une peau de caribou sur la plate-forme de l'iglou, ils furent réveillés en sursaut par un grognement effrayant. Taqqiq reconnut aussitôt ce bruit : c'était celui de l'ours. Il fallait réagir très vite. La grand-mère attrapa l'arc et la flèche posés près de ses bottes et les donna à Taqqiq :« Prends cet arc et cette flèche. C'est l'occasion de tuer ton premier ours. Je vais t'aider à viser, tu n'auras qu'à te laisser guider. »Ainsi fut dit, ainsi fut fait. Le craquement de la glace retentit sous le poids de l'ours, tombé raide mort. Un large sourire illumina le visage de Taqqiq. Aussi fut-il surpris quand sa grand-mère lui dit, feignant d'être très en colère :« Idiot ! C'est le chien que tu as tué ! Non seulement tu as manqué une proie superbe, mais en plus, tu nous prives de notre meilleur chien de traîneau. Tu n'es vraiment qu'un bon à rien ! »La grand-mère voulait garder la peau et la viande de l'ours pour elle toute seule. Elle rêvait déjà du pantalon qu'elle pourrait se coudre dans cette grande peau blanche, moelleuse et si chaude. Elle tua le chien et fit cuire sa chair. À chaque repas, elle servait ainsi de la viande de chien à Taqqiq, pendant qu'elle mangeait l'ours avec Siqiniq.Un soir, Siqiniq réussit à cacher de la viande d'ours sous sa parka et l'offrit en cachette à son frère :« Tiens, Taqqiq, voilà de la bonne viande d'ours ! »Taqqiq eut ainsi la preuve qu'il avait bien tué l'ours et que sa grand-mère était une menteuse, égoïste de surcroît. Il décida de se venger.« Petite sœur, pourrais-tu me guider jusqu'aux falaises, demain matin ?— Bien sûr, grand frère. » Le lendemain matin, Siqiniq accompagna Taqqiq près du rivage. Le paysage était magnifique et Siqiniq regrettait que son frère ne puisse pas le voir. Les falaises se reflétaient dans l'eau de la mer. Les derniers blocs de banquise dérivaient doucement le long de la côte. Quelques oiseaux s'y posaient de temps à autre. D'autres plongeaient à pic des sommets rocheux vers la mer, dans un brouhaha joyeux de cris auxquels les falaises répondaient en écho. Taqqiq percevait cette effervescence autour de lui et aurait été tellement heureux de voir enfin le soleil qui réchauffait son visage et les oiseaux qui piaillaient dans les falaises.« Merci, petite sœur, de m'avoir accompagné jusqu'ici. Laisse-moi seul maintenant. Tu peux rentrer au campement.— Mais comment feras-tu pour revenir ?— Je me débrouillerai. Ne t'inquiète pas. »Siqiniq prit le chemin du retour, laissant son frère seul, assis sur un rocher. Quand Siqiniq eut disparu derrière la colline, Taqqiq appela le plongeon arctique qu'il sentait voler tout près de lui :« Bonjour, plongeon. Les aînés disent que tu as des pouvoirs et que tu peux redonner la vue. Est-ce vrai ?— Oui, c'est vrai. Mais cela exige beaucoup de courage.— Je suis prêt. »Le plongeon prit Taqqiq entre ses pattes et le plongea une première fois dans l'eau glacée de la mer. Taqqiq ressortit immédiatement la tête de l'eau : le froid lui brûlait les tempes. Il reprit ses esprits et découvrit qu'il percevait un peu de lumière.Mais aussitôt, l'oiseau lui replongea la tête sous l'eau. Cette fois, Taqqiq réussit à rester un peu plus longtemps immergé, en apnée. Et quand il remonta pour respirer, il vit des formes, autour de lui.Une troisième fois, l'oiseau lui plongea la tête dans l'eau tellement longtemps que Taqqiq eut peur de se noyer. Lorsque le plongeon lâcha prise, le garçon revint enfin à la surface. Il put alors distinguer les oisillons qui prenaient leur premier envol, tout en haut, au sommet des falaises.Ébloui par tout ce qu'il découvrait, il remercia le plongeon et prit le chemin du campement. Il était si heureux qu'il sautillait d'un rocher à l'autre. Lui qui avait toujours marché prudemment, à tâtons pour ne pas tomber, il pouvait maintenant jouer comme les autres enfants.À l'approche de l'iglou, il ralentit son allure et reprit sa démarche hésitante. Personne ne devait savoir qu'il voyait de nouveau. La vie reprit son cours normal. La grand-mère continuait de brimer Taqqiq et celui-ci se demandait comment se venger. L'occasion rêvée arriva bientôt.Un matin, Taqqiq fut réveillé brutalement par sa grand-mère :« Dépêche-toi flemmard ! Tu n'entends pas tout ce bruit autour de toi ? Les bélugas sont arrivés ! Il ne faut pas rater cette occasion ! Enfile ton pantalon et ta parka, et prends le harpon. Nous partons ! Espérons que nous pourrons au moins en attraper un petit… »Quand ils arrivèrent sur la plage, la grand-mère enroula la corde du harpon autour de ses hanches :« Je vais t'aider à hisser le béluga hors de l'eau quand tu l'auras harponné. Mais comme je ne suis pas assez forte pour retenir un béluga adulte, il faut que tu en harponnes un petit. Laisse moi guider ton bras vers le jeune béluga que j'aperçois là-bas. Voilà. Tire maintenant ! »Mais plutôt que de choisir la petite baleine, Taqqiq lança son harpon vers un énorme mâle. La pointe se ficha solidement dans la chair de l'animal, qui, sous l'effet de la douleur, se mit à nager encore plus vite. La grand-mère n'eut pas le temps de se dégager de la lanière du harpon. Entraînée par le béluga, elle tomba dans la mer et fut emportée au loin, dans le sillage de l'animal.Le jeune garçon lui cria : « Toi qui as gardé la viande de l'ours pour toi seule, garde aussi celle-ci ! »La vieille femme réapparaissait de temps en temps à la surface et, avant qu'elle disparaisse définitivement, les enfants eurent juste le temps de voir ses cheveux se torsader et se figer en une longue défense d'ivoire.C'est ainsi que la méchante grand-mère s'est transformée en narval. \n",

Midas les départagea en choisissant Pan. Apollon, pour se venger, fit pousser des oreilles d'âne à Midas. Le roi essaya bien de les cacher, mais le barbier s'en aperçut. Ne pouvant garder un tel secret, le barbier creusa un trou dans la terre pour raconter ce qu'il avait vu et reboucha le trou aussitôt. Mais à cet emplacement, poussèrent des roseaux qui, dès le moindre coup de vent, ne pouvaient s'empêcher de répéter « Le roi Midas a des oreilles d'âne ! ».

      "  L'Air et la Terre avaient une fille : Écho. Cette charmante nymphe vivait dans les bois aux côtés de la déesse Artémis. Elle allait de rivières en torrents ; les arbres lui servaient de toit, la mousse et les jeunes pousses de lit. Elle ne connaissait ni tourment ni ennui. Un jour qu'elle babillait avec les autres nymphes, Écho fut accusée pas la grande déesse Héra d'aimer son époux infidèle. C'était une injustice, mais Héra, aveuglée par la colère, refusa d'écouter Écho, qui l'implorait. « Tu veux donc avoir le dernier mot ! », clama la déesse, folle de rage. Son châtiment ne tarda guère : bientôt, la nymphe devint incapable de parler. Ni phrase ni rire ne sortait plus de sa bouche. Elle répétait seulement les derniers mots qu'elle entendait. Écho était au désespoir. Cette punition était d'autant plus cruelle que notre jolie nymphe tomba éperdument amoureuse… Écho aimait Narcisse. Ce garçon était tellement plaisant que toutes les nymphes et toutes les jeunes filles espéraient recevoir de sa part un baiser. Mais le jeune homme était indifférent aux beautés qu'il croisait. Et jamais il ne sentait la présence d'Écho, qui le suivait pourtant aussi fidèlement que son ombre. La nymphe l'observait sans pouvoir lui parler, avec l'espoir pourtant d'en être un jour aimée. Un beau matin, elle tenta toutefois de se faire remarquer. Narcisse, à la recherche de ses amis, appelait : « Êtes-vous ici ? Y a-t-il quelqu'un par ici ? », et Écho lui répondait de sa jolie voix : « Ici, ici, ici… ». Narcisse lui demanda alors de venir et Écho, le cœur battant, apparut au jeune homme.Mais celui-ci s'en détourna immédiatement. Et sans la regarder, il cria : « Jamais, jamais… Penses-tu qu'un jour il se pourrait que je te donne pouvoir sur moi ? » Et la voix de la nymphe, entrecoupée de larmes, répéta, suppliante : « Je te donne pouvoir sur moi. » Mais déjà, Narcisse s'éloignait. Méprisée par celui qu'elle aimait, Écho s'enfuit à travers bois, jusqu'à trouver une grotte dans laquelle elle voulut cacher sa honte et son désespoir. Émue par le chagrin sincère de la nymphe, la déesse Némésis se résolut à la venger…  Narcisse se promenait comme à son habitude, lorsqu'il fut soudain pris d'une soif terrible. Il se laissa alors guider par Némésis jusqu'à une fontaine et il s'y pencha pour prendre une gorgée d'eau. Lorsqu'il vit son propre reflet, Narcisse en tomba amoureux. Dès lors, il ne cessa plus de contempler son beau visage dans l'eau limpide. Il se désespérait de ne pouvoir ni toucher ni aimer cette image, et il n'arrivait pas à s'en éloigner. Sa douleur était si grande qu'il appelait la mort, espérant ainsi se libérer d'un amour impossible. « Hélas, gémissait-il, je comprends bien maintenant toute la peine que j'ai causée à ces jeunes filles ! » Le temps s'écoulait et, progressivement, les pieds de Narcisse se changeaient en racines, son corps en tige, et sans qu'il s'en aperçût, le jeune homme se transforma en une jolie fleur, qui porte encore son nom. La folie de Narcisse n'avait pas apaisé la douleur d'Écho. Elle continuait à veiller sur lui. Et lorsque Narcisse dit adieu à son propre reflet, Écho répéta doucement, tristement : « Adieu… » Aujourd'hui, la nymphe a tant maigri qu'il ne reste que sa voix. Et, du fond de sa caverne, Écho répète encore les derniers mots des paroles qui lui sont adressées.  Narcisse et Écho est une légende très connue de la mythologie grecque. Son héros est à l'origine de la fleur qui porte son nom. Le narcisse est une plante à bulbe qui fleurit en mars et en avril. Selon l'espèce, ses fleurs sont blanches ou jaunes. Malgré sa beauté, le narcisse est une plante très toxique.  Le nom Narcisse a également donné naissance à l'adjectif « narcissique » qui qualifie une personne vaniteuse et égoïste, qui n'aime qu'elle-même. Qui sont les parents d'Écho ?  De quoi Écho est-elle injustement accusée ?  Comment Héra punit-elle Écho ?  De qui Écho tombe-t-elle amoureuse ?  Lorsque Narcisse rencontre Écho, il :  Quelle déesse décide de venger Écho ?

      "C'est pourquoi le chat mange le rat.  Ce conte berbère fait référence à l'arche de Noé qui, d'après la Bible, est un grand bateau que Dieu demanda à Noé de construire pour sauver sa famille du déluge. Mais revenons au début de l'histoire.Dieu, observant la méchanceté des hommes, décida de faire tomber sur la terre un déluge afin de détruire toute vie. Seul Noé, un homme juste, trouva grâce aux yeux de Dieu. Il fut donc choisi pour perpétuer sa lignée.Pour le sauver des eaux, Dieu lui demanda de bâtir une arche. Une fois construite, il dut monter à bord avec sa famille et un couple de chaque espèce animale existante.Après 220 jours de navigation dans des conditions très pénibles, l'arche s'échoua sur les Monts d'Ararat (sommet le plus haut de l'actuelle Turquie). Une fois qu'il put sortir de l'arche, Noé fit de nombreux sacrifices à Dieu, qui, satisfait, résolut de ne plus maudire la terre à cause de l'homme.En gage de cette promesse d'alliance avec l'homme, Dieu mit un arc-en-ciel dans les nuages, afin qu'il apparaisse à chaque fois qu'il s'apprêtera à pleuvoir. Qui brisa l'arche dans ce conte ?  Retrouve les animaux présents dans ce conte.  Qu'est-ce que l'arche de Noé ?  Combien de temps dura le périple de Noé ?  Pourquoi Dieu a t-il décidé de mettre un arc-en-ciel dans les nuages  ?  C'est pourquoi le chat mange le rat. \n",

      "  Orphée avait reçu de sa mère le don merveilleux de la musique, alors les dieux lui avaient fait cadeau d'une lyre. Depuis, il jouait de l'instrument au gré de ses envies ou de sa mélancolie, pour le plus grand plaisir des êtres qui l'entouraient.Le poète n'avait aucun ennemi, pas même les bêtes féroces : charmées, elles finissaient toujours par s'étendre à ses pieds. Bien sûr, aucune jeune fille ne pouvait résister aux notes tendres et apaisantes que faisait naître Orphée, mais aucune ne trouvait grâce à ses yeux, jusqu'au jour où il rencontra l'envoûtante Eurydice. Leur amour était si profond et si pur qu'ils décidèrent très rapidement de se marier. Mais ce bonheur fut de courte durée…  Le mariage fut une fête pour tous les invités, chacun se réjouissant du bonheur des jeunes époux. Mais tandis qu'elle prenait l'air avec ses amies, Eurydice fut mordue par un serpent, et dans la prairie résonnèrent les cris des jeunes filles épouvantées.Bientôt, Orphée parvint auprès de sa bien-aimée, inanimée. Le visage du jeune homme était transformé ; il ne pouvait laisser échapper ni larme ni cri tant sa douleur était grande. Comment pouvait-il perdre son épouse le jour même de leurs noces ? Et comment pouvait-il vivre sans celle qu'il aimait avec passion ?Cette idée lui était insupportable, aussi décida-t-il de descendre aux Enfers – le Royaume des morts – pour en ramener sa bien-aimée.  Les Enfers étaient peuplés de créatures terrifiantes, toutes soumises à Hadès, le dieu des profondeurs de la Terre. C'est lui qui régnait sur les morts, interdisant à quiconque ayant pénétré dans son royaume d'en ressortir vivant. Ce dieu était si terrible, que les vivants n'osaient pas même prononcer son nom ! L'entrée de son royaume était gardée par Cerbère. Certains disent qu'il avait trois têtes, d'autres cinquante, et d'autres encore, plus de cent ! Ce chien effroyable restait enchaîné devant la porte des Enfers pour terrifier les âmes qui cherchaient à s'y introduire. Mais Orphée n'eut aucun mal à adoucir le monstre… Une simple mélodie suffit à l'endormir, et il put passer la porte sans souci.Ce qu'il découvrit ensuite n'était guère réjouissant : les Enfers étaient un monde sombre, où coulaient de larges fleuves sans fond, un monde où les menaçantes Érinyes semaient la discorde, terrorisaient et punissaient à leur guise… Mais jamais Orphée ne fut inquiété. Il progressait, protégé par le son de sa lyre, et bientôt vit apparaître le palais d'Hadès et de son épouse Perséphone. Il entra sans peur et se présenta devant les dieux. « Que viens-tu faire ici ? » demanda Hadès de sa voix forte. Alors, pour toute réponse, Orphée entonna un chant incroyablement triste. Les notes de sa lyre emplissaient toutes les salles du palais, d'abord douces et mélancoliques, puis fortes et vibrantes, semblables à la douleur du poète. L'ensemble, bien sûr, était si enchanteur que les divinités infernales s'apaisèrent…Hadès et Perséphone consentirent à laisser partir Eurydice. Mais ils y mirent une condition : tant qu'il serait dans le Royaume des morts, Orphée ne chercherait pas à voir celle qu'il était venu quérir. Le jeune homme acquiesça avec joie et se mit en marche, suivi de sa jeune épouse. Orphée aperçut rapidement la lumière du jour : ils allaient enfin quitter les Enfers. Mais, tandis qu'il songeait au bonheur qui les attendait, le jeune homme oublia sa promesse, et il se retourna pour contempler sa bien-aimée… Pour son plus grand malheur, car la jeune fille retomba aussitôt dans les abîmes. Orphée avait vu Eurydice pour la dernière fois ! Le pauvre garçon en fut désespéré. Il tenta à nouveau de convaincre Hadès de lui rendre son aimée. Mais il n'eut pas de seconde chance ; le dieu resta insensible à ses supplications. Le poète se retira alors dans un lieu isolé où il chanta sa peine. Et nulle jeune fille ne put jamais le consoler. Orphée était le plus grand musicien de l'Antiquité. Apollon, le dieu du soleil, lui fit don d'une lyre grâce à laquelle il pouvait attendrir n'importe quelle créature. Il savait autant charmer les bêtes féroces que les arbres ou même les rochers qui se déplaçaient pour le suivre et l'écouter. C'est ainsi qu'Orphée réussit à entrer aux Enfers pour chercher sa bien-aimée Eurydice. Grâce à son talent, il charma Cerbère, le gardien de la porte des Enfers.  Le mythe d'Orphée est toujours associé à un objet symbolique : la lyre. Cet instrument à cordes qui ressemble à une petite harpe était extrêmement populaire dans l'Antiquité romaine. On pouvait en jouer assis ou debout et chanter en même temps. Aujourd'hui, la lyre est beaucoup moins répandue. Les Enfers, royaume du dieu Hadès, étaient peuplés d'êtres monstrueux. Cerbère était l'une de ces créatures.C'est lui qui gardait l'entrée de l'empire des morts. Il avait plusieurs têtes, certains disent qu'il en avait trois, d'autres cinquante, d'autres encore, plus de cent ! Ce chien monstrueux restait enchaîné devant la porte des Enfers.Il était l'une des créatures les plus difficiles à vaincre au monde. Hercule parvint cependant à le faire sortir des Enfers tandis qu'Orphée réussit à l'adoucir en lui jouant une douce mélodie.  Quel nom porte la bien-aimée d'Orphée ?  De quel malheur Eurydice fut-elle frappée le jour de son mariage ?  Qui garde la porte des Enfers ?  Grâce à quoi Orphée parvient-il à retrouver sa bien-aimée dans les Enfers ?  Quelle est la condition imposée par les dieux pour qu'Orphée puisse délivrer Eurydice des Enfers ?    Orphée avait reçu de sa mère le don merveilleux de la musique, alors les dieux lui avaient fait cadeau d'une lyre.

      "  Lorsque Zeus créa le monde, seuls les hommes peuplaient la Terre. Ils étaient protégés par Prométhée, un Titan farouchement opposé au pouvoir suprême du père des dieux. Dans la guerre qui opposait Zeus aux Titans, le rusé Prométhée parvint à dérober le feu aux divinités de l'Olympe et le donna aussitôt aux hommes. C'est ainsi qu'il subit le terrible châtiment qui l'enchaînait au Caucase. Mais Zeus ne pouvait en rester là et voulut se venger des êtres humains en leur offrant le plus bel objet de leur désir, afin de leur inspirer passions et tourments. Il créa la première femme, aussi fascinante que capricieuse.  Pandore, c'était son nom, fut façonnée à partir de l'argile. Zeus dut demander à Héphaïstos de l'aider, et ils mirent au jour la créature la plus parfaite au monde. Ainsi, après des jours et des jours de labeur, les dieux, impatients, se pressèrent pour admirer enfin la ravissante jeune femme. Zeus avait intimé l'ordre à Athéna de lui insuffler la vie, et Pandore s'anima, gracieuse et sublime. Mais elle ne pouvait se présenter ainsi aux hommes, et la déesse dut dissimuler sa nudité sous un voile vermeil et étincelant, alors qu'Aphrodite la parait de somptueux atours et donnait à ses traits le privilège de la beauté, auquel nul être ne saurait résister.Tous les dieux ajoutèrent à la nouvelle égérie un de leurs agréments pour atteindre à la perfection. Ainsi douée de tous les talents, elle excellait aussi dans l'art du mensonge, telle que l'avait voulu Hermès. Zeus n'était que trop fier de son admirable créature dont la tendresse n'avait pas d'égal, et il décida de la présenter à l'homme. Or, Prométhée avait un frère, Épiméthée, connu pour être quelque peu déraisonnable. Zeus décida de lui offrir la main de la douce Pandore. À sa vue, Épiméthée fut aussitôt envoûté par le charme de cette créature. Un sentiment jusque-là inconnu l'étreignit. L'éclat du regard de la jeune femme suffisait à inspirer la passion et l'émerveillement. Elle était si somptueuse qu'il en oublia la promesse faite à son frère : il avait fait le serment à Prométhée de ne jamais accepter de présents provenant de Zeus. Mais il avait été foudroyé par l'amour et aurait donné sa vie pour passer le restant de ses jours auprès de la belle Pandore, qu'il gardait alors jalousement près de lui, loin des regards envieux des autres hommes, s'évertuant à satisfaire le moindre de ses désirs. Avant d'envoyer Pandore sur Terre, les dieux lui avaient remis une boîte, sans lui dire ce qu'elle contenait, et ils lui ordonnèrent de ne jamais l'ouvrir. Aux côtés de son époux, Pandore jouissait de la vie et savourait son bonheur. Elle avait dissimulé la cassette des dieux, mais ses regards intrigués se portaient souvent sur elle, et comme celle-ci n'avait pas de serrure, il lui était difficile de réprimer son désir de connaître son contenu.Elle passait et repassait devant le coffret sans oser y porter la main, attirée par l'envie de lui ôter son couvercle, mais aussitôt arrêtée par le souvenir de l'interdiction formelle des dieux. Un jour, n'y tenant plus, elle s'approcha irrésistiblement de la boîte, et piquée par une trop vive curiosité, Pandore sentit grincer le délicat objet sous sa main. À peine eut-elle entrouvert la mystérieuse boîte que tous les maux de l'humanité qu'elle renfermait s'échappèrent. Ainsi, la guerre, la maladie, le vice, la vieillesse, la perfidie, la misère et tant d'autres fléaux encore se répandirent. Figée par l'effroi, consciente de son impardonnable faute, Pandore se décida à refermer le funeste coffret, mais en vain, car tout s'était envolé…Tout, à l'exception de l'espérance qui s'éveillait lentement au fond de la boîte, fragile et solitaire.  Ainsi l'espérance peut être perçue comme un terrible mal, le plus atroce tourment que l'homme garde au fond de lui-même. Pour certains, au contraire, elle suggère que l'homme, lorsqu'il se voit frappé par le malheur, ne doit jamais perdre espoir… Comment s'appelle le père des dieux, créateur du monde ?  Prométhée est un Titan qui protège les hommes.  Prométhée a dérobé quelque chose aux divinités pour l'offrir aux hommes. De quoi s'agit-il ?  Pour créer Pandore à partir d'argile, Zeus fait appel à :  Qui aide Pandore à se vêtir ?  Avant d'envoyer Pandore sur Terre, les dieux remettent à Pandore :  Pandore promet aux dieux de ne jamais :    Lorsque Zeus créa le monde, seuls les hommes peuplaient la Terre. Ils étaient protégés par Prométhée, un Titan farouchement opposé au pouvoir suprême du père des dieux. Dans la guerre qui opposait Zeus aux Titans, le rusé Prométhée parvint à dérober le feu aux divinités de l'Olympe et le donna aussitôt aux hommes. C'est ainsi qu'il subit le terrible châtiment qui l'enchaînait au Caucase. Mais Zeus ne pouvait en rester là et voulut se venger des êtres humains en leur offrant le plus bel objet de leur désir, afin de leur inspirer passions et tourments. Il créa la première femme, aussi fascinante que capricieuse.  Pandore, c'était son nom, fut façonnée à partir de l'argile. Zeus dut demander à Héphaïstos de l'aider, et ils mirent au jour la créature la plus parfaite au monde. Ainsi, après des jours et des jours de labeur, les dieux, impatients, se pressèrent pour admirer enfin la ravissante jeune femme. Zeus avait intimé l'ordre à Athéna de lui insuffler la vie, et Pandore s'anima, gracieuse et sublime. Mais elle ne pouvait se présenter ainsi aux hommes, et la déesse dut dissimuler sa nudité sous un voile vermeil et étincelant, alors qu'Aphrodite la parait de somptueux atours et donnait à ses traits le privilège de la beauté, auquel nul être ne saurait résister.Tous les dieux ajoutèrent à la nouvelle égérie un de leurs agréments pour atteindre à la perfection. Ainsi douée de tous les talents, elle excellait aussi dans l'art du mensonge, telle que l'avait voulu Hermès. Zeus n'était que trop fier de son admirable créature dont la tendresse n'avait pas d'égal, et il décida de la présenter à l'homme. Or, Prométhée avait un frère, Épiméthée, connu pour être quelque peu déraisonnable. Zeus décida de lui offrir la main de la douce Pandore. À sa vue, Épiméthée fut aussitôt envoûté par le charme de cette créature. Un sentiment jusque-là inconnu l'étreignit. L'éclat du regard de la jeune femme suffisait à inspirer la passion et l'émerveillement. Elle était si somptueuse qu'il en oublia la promesse faite à son frère : il avait fait le serment à Prométhée de ne jamais accepter de présents provenant de Zeus.

      "  La déesse Déméter, protectrice de la Nature, avait une fille unique qu'elle chérissait. C'était une très belle enfant, fraîche comme un bouton de fleur et rosée comme les fruits qui mûrissent lentement au soleil. Cette jeune fille s'appelait Perséphone. Notre déesse attentionnée passait beaucoup de temps avec l'adolescente ; elle lui enseignait les secrets de la terre, lui parlait des céréales, des légumes et des fruits qu'elle faisait croître. Et la vie suivait son cours… Pendant ce temps, au royaume des morts, le dieu Hadès observait Déméter et sa fille. Il avait remarqué la beauté de Perséphone et il espérait secrètement l'épouser. Il conçut pour cela un astucieux stratagème. Comme cela lui arrivait fréquemment, Déméter partit en voyage. Hadès fit alors fleurir une multitude de narcisses. C'était une belle journée, Perséphone sortit avec une amie. Elle flânait, insouciante, dans la campagne fleurie de narcisses, s'attardait pour en faire un bouquet, s'éloignant ainsi de sa compagne. Cet instant fut propice au dieu des morts… Alors qu'elle se penchait pour ramasser une fleur, le sol s'ouvrit et Hadès surgit dans toute sa splendeur. Perséphone, surprise, ne put alerter son amie et elle fut emportée dans les profondeurs de la Terre. Nul ne pouvait sortir du monde souterrain sans le consentement d'Hadès.C'était un lieu terrible, peuplé de monstres et d'ombres. L'air y était irrespirable, plein de gémissements, de souffrance et de cris, auxquels succédait parfois un sinistre silence.En découvrant cet univers, si différent de celui qu'elle connaissait, Perséphone ne put retenir ses larmes. C'est ainsi qu'elle devint reine des Enfers.  En revenant de son voyage, Déméter s'alarma de ne pas trouver sa fille chez elle, comme elle en avait l'habitude.Alors, la déesse de la Nature quitta l'Olympe et partit à la recherche de Perséphone… Déméter était si triste d'avoir perdu son enfant qu'elle refusait de faire germer les graines. Plus rien ne poussait et les hommes et les animaux mouraient de faim. Puis un jour, enfin, la déesse apprit le nom du ravisseur. Indignée, elle alla trouver Zeus et demanda qu'on lui rende Perséphone. Depuis longtemps déjà, Zeus était inquiet… La Terre avait trop souffert de cette situation ! Il prit donc parti pour la déesse : « Mais, rappelle-toi, si ta fille goûte aux fruits de l'empire des ombres, elle ne pourra en ressortir. » Et aussitôt, Zeus ordonna au dieu des Enfers de relâcher la captive. Malheureusement, Perséphone avait déjà mangé quelques grains de grenade. Hadès refusa alors de la libérer complètement. Pour revoir sa mère, la jeune fille dut promettre de revenir régulièrement près du puissant dieu.  Lorsque Déméter retrouva enfin son enfant, elle laissa éclater sa joie de la plus belle manière qui soit : elle fit reverdir les champs et recouvrit les arbres de fleurs et de bourgeons. Quel soulagement alors pour les hommes, les femmes et tous les animaux ! Mais Perséphone ne pouvait rester plus de quatre mois auprès de cette mère aimante et généreuse, et la séparation qui s'ensuivit fut un nouveau déchirement pour la déesse de la Nature… Elle ne supportait pas de voir la Mort s'emparer de la beauté de son enfant pour la garder si longtemps enfermée dans le triste royaume des Enfers. Perséphone siégeait alors auprès d'Hadès. Elle gardait sa fraîcheur et sa beauté mais, si loin des plaisirs du monde vivant, elle prenait un air sombre et tragique… jusqu'à ce qu'elle retrouve sa mère. Petit à petit, la Nature, les mortels et les animaux se sont habitués aux allées et venues de Perséphone…À chaque printemps, Déméter retrouve sa fille pour une ou deux saisons seulement, et la Nature, si triste en hiver, reprend alors vie. Dans les profondeurs de la Terre, se trouve un terrible palais : celui d'Hadès, le dieu des Enfers. C'est lui qui règne sur les morts, interdisant à quiconque, ayant pénétré dans son royaume, d'en ressortir vivant. Et cela ne servirait à rien de chercher à fuir ! Grâce à son casque, Hadès peut devenir invisible et rattraper ainsi ceux qui tentent de lui échapper. Et il y a aussi Cerbère, un chien monstrueux à trois têtes, qui garde l'entrée des Enfers.Il n'est donc pas étonnant que les vivants craignent de prononcer le nom du souverain des morts !  Quel dieu souhaite secrètement épouser Perséphone ?  Quelles plantes fait fleurir Hadès ?    La déesse Déméter, protectrice de la Nature, avait une fille unique qu'elle chérissait.

      "  Vous vous souvenez de Sanna… Elle était retournée vivre auprès de son père, dans l'iglou familial. Elle était toujours aussi séduisante, et toujours aussi têtue ! Elle continuait de refuser catégoriquement de se marier. Dans le village, tout le monde ne parlait plus que de Uinigumasuittuq, « celle qui ne veut pas se marier ». Son père, maintenant très vieux, ne pouvait plus partir chasser. De plus en plus souvent, la marmite restait vide et la famine menaçait.Cet hiver-là, la nuit polaire parut très longue au chasseur et à sa fille. La graisse de phoque, indispensable pour allumer la lampe à huile, venait régulièrement à manquer. Les repas étaient de plus en plus frugaux. Heureusement, les parents et les amis du campement partageaient le fruit de leur chasse avec les deux malheureux, et le printemps revint enfin. Peu après le retour des premiers rayons du soleil, le paysage se mit à changer rapidement. Petit à petit, la banquise se disloqua et on vit bientôt arriver, entre les blocs de glace dispersés, un kayak.Il était manœuvré par un étrange personnage, d'assez grande taille, inconnu des habitants du village. Il portait des lunettes de neige en bois de caribou et un très long manteau en peau de caribou. Il traversa le campement jusqu'au plus petit iglou, où il trouva la jeune fille en train de gratter une peau de phoque.« Bonjour. Je suis venu de très loin pour te rencontrer. J'habite une petite île, perdue dans l'océan Arctique. Mais ta réputation extraordinaire est parvenue jusque chez moi. On dit que tu es la plus belle jeune fille de la région, et également la meilleure couturière.— Quel beau manteau en peau de caribou ! Tu dois vraiment être un très grand chasseur !— Oui, et je pourrais t'offrir tout ce dont tu as besoin, si tu acceptais de m'épouser. » C'est ainsi que la jeune fille, séduite par le bel étranger, accepta de le suivre. Ils partirent rapidement par la mer, vers l'île lointaine. Ils naviguèrent longtemps avant d'arriver enfin sur un îlot rocailleux.L'étranger arrima son embarcation à une grosse pierre et aida sa nouvelle épouse à descendre. Elle fut très étonnée de ne voir personne les accueillir. L'île semblait déserte. Il y avait bien quelques oiseaux mais aucun être humain ni aucune habitation n'apparaissait à l'horizon.C'est alors que l'étranger retira ses lunettes de neige… Quelle ne fut pas la stupeur de Sanna en découvrant les yeux de son mari, rouges, globuleux et sans paupières ! Il ricana et ôta son manteau en peau de caribou. Apparurent alors ses ailes et sa queue, sur laquelle il s'était dressé pour se rehausser. Le bel étranger n'était autre qu'un fulmar boréal, l'oiseau des tempêtes, déguisé en homme afin de séduire la jeune fille. Celle-ci, comprenant la supercherie, se mit à pleurer. Mais il était trop tard. Elle était maintenant seule avec lui, sur cette île déserte, très loin de son père et de ses amis. Elle se sentit prisonnière. Mais le fulmar boréal tenta de la rassurer : « Ne t'inquiète pas, je suis un excellent pêcheur. Tous les soirs, je te rapporterai du poisson, tu ne manqueras de rien. »Et les jours passèrent ainsi. Tous les matins, le fulmar partait pêcher et tous les soirs, il rapportait du poisson à sa femme. Et l'été arriva. Le soleil avait maintenant complètement renoncé à se coucher et la mer était totalement libre de glace. Cela faisait déjà quelque temps que la jeune fille avait quitté le campement et son père ne l'avait pas revue depuis. Qu'était-elle donc devenue ? Pourquoi ne lui rendait-elle pas visite comme le font d'habitude les Inuit ?Inquiet, il décida de partir à sa recherche. Il profita d'une belle journée pour prendre la mer. Le temps était calme et la mer aussi lisse que l'huile de phoque qui se consume doucement dans la lampe. Il rama pendant de longues heures avant d'accoster sur la petite île. Sa fille, qui l'avait vu arriver de loin, courut sur le rivage pour l'accueillir et se jeta dans ses bras. Elle lui expliqua comment elle avait été dupée par l'oiseau déguisé en homme. Ils montèrent alors dans la petite embarcation et prirent rapidement la fuite. Peu de temps après, le fulmar boréal revint, fatigué, de sa journée de pêche. Étonné de ne pas voir sa femme, il s'éleva très haut dans le ciel afin de la repérer plus facilement. Il ne tarda pas à apercevoir l'embarcation qui s'éloignait, là-bas, à l'horizon… Fou de rage, il se mit à battre très rapidement des ailes pour rattraper les deux fuyards.Il frappait si fort des ailes qu'une tempête se leva. Le vent se mit à souffler, la mer à grossir, les vagues à grandir. La mer était déchaînée et l'embarcation tanguait dangereusement. Le fulmar boréal se rapprochait, et plus il s'approchait, plus le petit bateau risquait de chavirer. Pris de panique, le père jeta sa fille par-dessus bord. Elle tomba dans l'eau glacée mais réussit à s'agripper au plat-bord de l'embarcation. Comme son poids déséquilibrait le bateau, qui commençait à se remplir d'eau, le père affolé sortit son couteau et trancha les doigts de sa fille. Sanna coula au fond de la mer mais chacun de ses doigts, en touchant l'eau, se transforma en mammifère marin. Ils donnèrent naissance aux morses, aux baleines boréales, aux narvals, aux bélugas… La jeune fille devint ainsi la mère de tous les mammifères marins.Depuis ce jour, elle vit au fond de la mer, où est installée sa demeure. Elle veille aux échanges entre les hommes et les animaux. Les Inuit lui ont donné plusieurs noms : Sanna, « Celle-là », mais aussi Takannaaluk, « La grande, là, en bas ». Comme elle n'a plus de doigts, elle ne peut plus se coiffer et ses cheveux s'emmêlent. Et, chaque fois que les Inuit enfreignent un tabou, qu'ils font des choses interdites, un nouveau nœud se forme dans ses cheveux et Sanna se met très en colère. Lorsque ses cheveux sont trop emmêlés, les mammifères marins y restent coincés et ne peuvent plus remonter à la surface pour respirer ; les Inuit, ne pouvant plus les capturer, sont condamnés à la famine. Pour éviter cela, le chamane doit alors descendre au fond de la mer et démêler les cheveux de Sanna en lui avouant les tabous qui ont été enfreints. Nœud après nœud, le chamane libère les animaux qui remontent à la surface s'offrir aux chasseurs.  Les flocons de neige sont des agglomérations de milliers de cristaux de glace.Ces cristaux naissent et se développent au sein des nuages à partir de gouttelettes d'eau liquides. C'est lorsque ces gouttelettes d'eau rencontrent des « poussières » en suspension dans l'air qu'elles se transforment en cristaux de glace. Ensuite, les gouttelettes environnantes viennent s'agglutiner sur ces particules de glace naissantes. Le cristal se met alors à grossir, devient lourd et tombe en capturant dans sa chute d'autres cristaux. On assiste à la formation d'un flocon de neige !Lors de leur chute vers le sol, les flocons de neige se transforment constamment ; ils peuvent se briser, fusionner avec d'autres flocons ou bien fondre. Leur forme et leur taille varient en fonction de la température et de l'humidité. En général, on observe les plus gros flocons quand la température est proche de 0 °C et le vent faible. Quand il fait très froid, les flocons de neige sont toujours petits parce que l'air froid ne contient pas assez d'humidité pour les faire grossir. Les Inuits (dont la chasse, les déplacements, la construction d'abris, etc. dépendent des conditions d'enneigement) ont le vocabulaire le plus abondant et le plus précis pour décrire la neige.En voici quelques exemples : aniu : neige que l'on fait fondre pour obtenir de l'eau ; aniugaviniq : neige très dure, compacte et gelée ; apigianngaut : toute première chute de neige de l'automne ; aput : neige au sol ; atsakaaq : boule de neige obtenue en roulant la neige sur le sol ; mannguq : neige mouillée fondante ; qannik : neige qui tombe, flocons.   Au début de l'histoire, Sanna ne veut pas se marier.  Dans le village, Sanna et son père vivent dans :  L'inconnu qui arrive en kayak porte :  Finalement, le mari de Sanna se révèle être :  Le père de Sanna rend visite à sa fille en :  Les doigts coupés de Sanna se transforment en :    Vous vous souvenez de Sanna… Elle était retournée vivre auprès de son père, dans l'iglou familial. Elle était toujours aussi séduisante, et toujours aussi têtue ! Elle continuait de refuser catégoriquement de se marier. Dans le village, tout le monde ne parlait plus que de Uinigumasuittuq, « celle qui ne veut pas se marier ». Son père, maintenant très vieux, ne pouvait plus partir chasser.

      "  Il était une fois un jeune homme, prénommé Urashimataro, qui vivait avec sa mère dans un petit village au bord de la mer. Tous les jours il allait pêcher, et il survivait ainsi avec sa mère grâce aux poissons qu'il capturait. Un jour, bien qu'ayant passé toute la journée en mer, Urashimataro ne ramena que trois poissons, et ce fut le cœur gros qu'il rentra chez lui.Sur la plage, un groupe d'enfants chahutait. Le jeune homme, se demandant ce qui pouvait bien les amuser autant, se dirigea vers eux. Les enfants avaient attrapé une tortue et la maltraitaient.Urashimataro avait bon cœur, et il voulut sauver la pauvre bête.  Il dit aux garnements qu'il ne fallait pas faire de mal aux animaux, mais ceux-ci ricanèrent et continuèrent de plus belle. Urashimataro comprit que les enfants ne libéreraient pas la tortue, et décida de l'échanger contre les quelques poissons qu'il avait pêchés dans la journée. Les garnements lui cédèrent la tortue, et il put remettre la pauvre bête à la mer. Elle partit vers le large et, tout en nageant, ne cessa de se retourner pour regarder Urashimataro. Quelques jours plus tard, Urashimataro pêchait en mer, lorsqu'une grosse tortue apparut près de sa barque. Le jeune homme stupéfait l'écouta.« Il y a quelques jours, tu as sauvé une tortue ; nous te remercions et, comme marque de notre reconnaissance, nous t'invitons au palais du Royaume de la mer. Monte sur mon dos, je vais t'y conduire. »Urashimataro s'installa sur la carapace de la tortue, et il s'enfonça avec elle dans les flots.  La tortue nageait, nageait, et Urashimataro, émerveillé, regardait les poissons, les algues, tous ces êtres merveilleux vivant au fond de la mer. Ils arrivèrent au palais, où tout était beau et magnifique, au-delà de toute imagination. Une princesse, la plus belle jeune femme qu'Urashimataro ait jamais vue, l'accueillit et lui dit :« Je te remercie de m'avoir aidée. Je suis la tortue que tu as sauvée de ces méchants enfants. Je voulais voir le monde du dessus de l'eau et pour cela je m'étais changée en tortue. Tu m'as sauvé la vie. »Elle lui fit ensuite visiter le palais, le présenta au roi, son père, et lui offrit un véritable festin. Urashimataro vécut ainsi heureux au palais, tout aux plaisirs de la vie au fond de la mer. Il avait oublié son village natal et sa mère. Trois années s'écoulèrent ainsi, comme dans un rêve. Un jour, la princesse emmena Urashimataro dans une pièce où il n'était jamais entré. Par la fenêtre, on pouvait voir le monde du dessus de l'eau. Le jeune homme vit son village natal, et soudain tout lui revint en mémoire. Il fut pris de nostalgie. Il voulut rentrer chez lui et revoir sa mère. La princesse en fut attristée, mais elle ne pouvait pas s'opposer au départ d'Urashimataro. Elle lui offrit en souvenir une cassette précieuse et lui dit : « Si tu te trouves dans une situation difficile, ouvre-la. »  Urashimataro remercia la princesse, prit le coffret et s'installa sur le dos de la tortue qui devait le ramener dans le monde du dessus de l'eau.Une fois arrivé, Urashimataro traversa le village pour rentrer chez lui, et un étrange malaise l'envahit. Le village, les maisons étaient un peu différents de ceux de son souvenir, et les gens qu'il rencontrait lui étaient tous inconnus. Lorsqu'il arriva là où il avait vécu, quelle ne fut pas sa surprise de voir qu'il n'y avait plus trace de sa demeure, qu'il ne restait que des herbes folles !Il parcourut alors les rues en interrogeant les villageois, mais personne n'avait entendu parler de la maison d'Urashimataro.Enfin, l'homme le plus âgé du village lui dit :« Urashimataro ? Si mes souvenirs sont exacts, c'est ce jeune homme parti en mer et qui n'est jamais revenu. Mais c'est une histoire qui a maintenant trois cents ans, mon garçon ! »  Urashimataro comprit alors que les trois ans passés au palais étaient en fait trois cents années. Il se mit à la recherche de la tombe de sa mère ; non seulement il la trouva, mais il vit également la sienne. Le jeune homme fut terriblement triste à l'idée de ne plus jamais revoir sa mère. Il était malheureux et se sentit si désespéré qu'il ouvrit la cassette que la princesse lui avait offerte. Une épaisse fumée s'en échappa et l'enveloppa entièrement, le transformant en vieillard. Alors Urashimataro devenu très, très âgé se transforma en grue, oiseau dont on dit qu'il vit mille ans, et il s'élança dans le ciel. La grue survola la mer et alla à la rencontre de son amie la tortue, animal qui, paraît-il, peut vivre dix mille ans. Des villageois qui se trouvaient sur la plage, les voyant, s'écrièrent : « Longue vie à la grue et à la tortue ! Et dix mille ans de bonheur ! »  Comme le serpent, le lézard ou le crocodile, la tortue appartient à la famille des reptiles. Elle est facilement reconnaissable car c'est la seule à posséder une carapace. Il existe de nombreuses tortues, d'espèces et de tailles variées : de 15 cm pour la tortue-boîte jusqu'à environ 2,4 m pour la tortue luth.Certaines d'entre elles vivent sur la terre. Elles ont de courtes pattes et marchent très lentement.D'autres préfèrent la mer. Elles ont de grosses carapaces et des pattes en forme de nageoires. La tortue vit dans de nombreuses régions du monde, sauf les zones très froides. D'ailleurs, pendant l'hiver, elle hiberne dans sa carapace en attendant les beaux jours.Elle est évidemment réputée pour sa lenteur, mais aussi pour sa longévité. En effet, certaines tortues vivent plus de cent ans !  Comment naissent les tortues de mer ?Lorsque la marée est au plus bas, la femelle tortue se rend la nuit sur la plage. Elle peut alors pondre jusqu'à deux cents œufs dans le sable.À la chaleur du soleil, les œufs éclosent et les petits rejoignent vite la mer. Comment font les tortues de mer pour respirer ?Les tortues de mer respirent de l'air à la surface. Une fois sous l'eau, elles peuvent retenir leur souffle pendant plusieurs heures. Quel est le métier d'Urashimataro ?  Sur la plage, quel animal est maltraité par des garnements ?  En guise de remerciements, Urashimataro est invité au :  La tortue sauvée est en réalité :  Lors du séjour d'Urashimataro au palais, combien de temps s'est-il réellement écoulé ?  À la fin de l'histoire, les villageois souhaitent dix mille ans de bonheur :  Quel animal n'est pas un reptile ?  La tortue de mer a une grosse carapace et des pattes en forme de nageoires.
