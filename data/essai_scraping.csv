            A US farmworker who caught bird flu after working with dairy cattle in Texas appears to be the first known case of mammal-to-human transmission of the virus, a new study shows.
     
            The dairy worker sought care in late March after developing painful red, swollen, weeping eyes with burst blood vessels.Â He had no fever, however, and his lungs were clear, according to a letter about the case that was published in theÂ New England Journal of MedicineÂ on Friday.
     
            He reported no contact with sick or dead birds or other animals, but he did have repeated direct close contact with dairy cows in the same part of the state with other infected herds.
     
            Even though the man didnât become seriously ill, his case is important because it confirms that humans can be infected with H5N1 after contact with cows.Â At the same time, it also leaves critical questions unanswered about a virus that the study authors said has âpandemic potential,â and it illustrates how hard it will be to track the infection in this vulnerable population of workers, where testing positive for an infectious disease might mean losing days of work and pay.
     
            âFor farmworkers specifically, certainly these are folks that are that are living in a state of economic desperation, and what theyâre not going to do is, theyâre not going to test for something if they donât have paid sick leave, because they cannot afford to be sent home and told to stay home and not work,â said Elizabeth Strater, director of strategic campaigns for United Farm Workers.
     
            Strater says UFW, like other groups, has heard rumors that there are dairy workers who are sick but donât want to be tested, but she said itâs nothing that theyâre able to confirm.
     
            Health officials in Texas said they did test other sick dairy workers, including some with red eyes, but they turned out to have other illnesses, not bird flu.
     
            âThe people tested volunteered to be tested,â said Lara Anton, senior press officer with the Texas Department of State Health Services.
     
            âItâs likely there were other people with symptoms who did not want to be tested so we cannot say with absolute certainty that no one else contracted H5N1. We can say for sure some of the people on dairy farms tested positive for other respiratory viruses that are commonly circulating in the human population,â Anton said.
     
            In the case of the man who did test positive for bird flu, he took antiviral medications and recovered without any lasting problems, and his close family members received the drugs as a precaution, the letter says.
     
            Swabs of the patientâs eyes and lungs revealed something interesting, too: His eyes were teeming with the H5N1 virus, but there was hardly any virus in his lungs.Â That could mean the worker was infected through his eyes â either by rubbing them with contaminated hands or through splashes of contaminated milk â rather than through his lungs, and the virus never migrated there, or that the virus couldnât get a foothold in his lungs because it was adapted primarily to infect birds, not cells in the human airway.
     
            The letter on the case was written by researchers at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention along with doctors at the Texas Department of State Health Services and researchers at the Texas Tech Bioterrorism Response Laboratory.
     
            Health officials said they couldnât do further investigation of how the man was infected because âepidemiological investigations were not able to be conducted at the farmâ where he worked.Â  They were also unable to test other workers at the same farm.
     
            That kind of testing is critical to answer questions about how the worker became infected, whether others were being infected and if so, for how long they were infected and what kind of symptoms they had, if they had any at all.
     
            The CDC is looking for farms that will allow it to conduct such a detailed study.
     
            âUnderstanding the current avian flu outbreak among dairy cattle is a vital priority to help protect human health,â the agency said in a statement to CNN. âDiscussions are under way with farms in multiple jurisdictions to participate in CDC-led epidemiological studies. In the meantime, states continue to test symptomatic farm workers and monitor those who have been exposed to infected animals. CDC also continues to closely monitor a robust, nationwide flu surveillance system. To date, it has not detected any unusual flu activity.â
     
            At a news briefing Friday, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said the administration was monitoring the situation âvery closely and taking this very seriously.â

            Gas and propane stoves significantly increase exposure to nitrogen dioxide in rooms throughout the home, and these unsafe levels of exposure have had harmful effects on the health of tens of thousands of people in the United States, according to a new study.
     
            The World Health Organization has set guidelines for exposure to various air pollutants, and the new research â published in the journal Science on Friday â found that people reach 75% of the suggested annual limit for nitrogen dioxide just by using a gas stove. Electric stoves, on the other hand, did not cause any emissions of nitrogen dioxide.
     
            Breathing air with high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide can irritate the respiratory system. Short-term exposure can exacerbate respiratory diseases, while longer exposures can contribute to the development of conditions like asthma and increase susceptibility to respiratory infections.
     
            âThere really is no safe amount of exposure to these toxicants produced by gas or propane or any fossil fuel, outside or inside. We were not meant as a human species to be breathing these toxicants in,â Dr. Kari Nadeau, chair of the environmental health department at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and co-author of the new study, said at a news conference about the research.
     
            More than a third of households in the US â nearly 50 million â have a gas or propane stove, according to data from the US Energy Information Administration.
     
            But size and layout of a home, ventilation and behaviors â such as cooking patterns â can affect levels of exposure to nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves, which leaves many disadvantaged communities at increased risk for the negative health effects.
     
            People who live in residences that are less than 800 square feet are exposed to four times more nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves than people who live in residences that are larger than 3,000 square feet, according to the new study.
     
            âBecause of historical and present day discrimination, this disparity and exposure by housing size manifests as disparities and exposure by income and race and ethnic group,â Yannai Kashtan, a researcher with the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability and lead author of the new study said at the news  briefing.
     
            For American Indian, Black and Hispanic people in the US, exposure to nitrogen dioxide exceeds the World Health Organizationâs benchmark just from using a gas stove, excluding any contribution from outdoor air, the new research found. Exposure levels are 60% higher than average for American Indian people and 20% higher than average for Black and Hispanic people in the US.
     
            The negative effects of exposure to nitrogen dioxide from a gas stove are not limited to those who spend the most time cooking or in the kitchen, the researchers found. In the bedrooms that were tested, concentrations of nitrogen dioxide exceeded the World Health Organizationâs 1-hour exposure guideline within 25 minutes of cooking.
     
            âThe pollution we measure travels from the kitchen to distant bedrooms, and it travels far and fast,â said Rob Jackson, a professor of Earth system science at Stanford and senior fellow with the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment and Precourt Institute for Energy who was the principal investigator for the new research. âIt moves through the home very quickly. It doesnât only reach our bedrooms quickly, it lingers in the air for hours.â
     
            The cooks bear the greatest burden â which disproportionately affects women â but everyone in the home is in danger of breathing in pollution, he said.
     
            For this study, researchers measured nitrogen dioxide concentrations and emissions in more than 100 homes across five states. They combined these findings with national demographic data to estimate exposures and potential impacts across the US.
     
            Overall, they estimate that long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves caused about 50,000 current cases of pediatric asthma in the US. That estimate grows to about 200,000 cases of pediatric asthma when factoring in other toxins released by the flames from gas stoves and short-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide. Also, the researchers estimate that about 19,000 premature deaths may be attributable to long-term exposure to nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves.
     
            Experts say that itâs important to minimize cooking with gas stoves as much as possible. The pollution comes from the flames, so cooking for shorter periods of time and with lower heat can help reduce emissions.
     
            âThe key thing is to use less gas,â Jackson said. âThereâs a direct linear relationship between the amount of gas burned and the amount of pollution that comes off. So everything we do to reduce gas â use one burner at a time â helps people helps their health.â
     
            Many who rent or have limited income may not be able to replace their stove, but using a induction cooktop to boil water or perform some other cooking tasks can help. Keeping the cooking space and household well-ventilated, with new air circulating every couple of hours, is also important.
     
            âMost of us spend 90% of our time or more inside. Thatâs the air that weâre breathing most of the time,â Jackson said. â(The Environmental Protection Agency) does not regulate or measure indoor air quality, so we need to take ownership and act to clean up peopleâs air because it is the air most people breathe, and we have ignored it for decades.â

            On Tuesday afternoon, Mikenzie Buchanan scooped up an armful of clipboards piled behind the front desk at A Womanâs Choice, an abortion clinic here; it was almost too many to hold. On each clipboard, behind a blue cover to protect personal information, were documents and charts for patients who had visited the clinic to receive a medication abortion that day.
     
            âStarting tomorrow, I will be making a lot less of these,â said Buchanan, who has been working at the front desk for a few months.
     
            Over the past couple of days, the Jacksonville clinic had been seeing two to four times as many patients as it typically would. But today, May 1, a significant shift in Floridaâs abortion law takes effect, cutting the 15-week ban down to a six-week ban â a time before many womenÂ know theyâre pregnant.
     
            The new restrictions will reverberate through the state and the broader region, as Florida has become a key abortion access point for the South in the years since the US Supreme Courtâs Dobbs decision revoked the federal right to an abortion.
     
            Buchanan is often the first person people see when they arrive for their appointments. Some patients who come in arenât familiar with the new six-week ban, but many are worried and stressed about âbeating the clock,â she said. âI feel a sense of urgency, too. I donât want to add any stress to it. But behind the scenes, weâre definitely making sure that they can be seen as quickly as possible and get where they need to go.â
     
            Candace, a Jacksonville resident and 36-year-old mother of two, learned about Floridaâs six-week ban when she called A Womanâs Choice to make an appointment for an abortion. She was within that limit when she had her appointment on Tuesday but worries about what it means for the future, including for her teenage daughter.
     
            âI feel relieved to be able to get in, and I feel lucky that, you know, right now, I do have a voice, and I have a right over my own body. But waking up tomorrow â itâs devastating. I know my daughter and myself are waking up tomorrow with less rights than we do today,â she said.Â The newÂ time limitÂ raisesÂ fear in Candace,Â who has experienced high-risk pregnancies andÂ traumatic births,Â including the death of a newborn.Â Now, she worries that sheâsÂ at even greaterÂ riskÂ since sheâs older than 35.
     
            âIâm terrified,â she said. âMy life matters.â
     
            Candace said she would have preferred to get a surgical abortion but opted for medication abortion to leave space for the many women who may need to travel from other states.
     
            Last year, nearly 8,000 people traveled from out of state to receive an abortion in Florida, according to data from the state health department â thatâs nearly a tenth of all abortions that happened in the state and three times more than five years ago. After the Dobbs decision, nine of the 16 states in the South banned abortion. Florida now joins Georgia and South Carolina with a six-week ban. This leaves just three states in this US Census region â Delaware, Maryland and Virginia â where abortion remains legal past the first trimester and North Carolina with a 12-week limit.
     
            The parking lot behind the single-story gray building that houses the A Womanâs Choice clinic in Jacksonville had been full for weeks leading up to the new ban,Â and some patients had to park in neighboring lots,Â a group ofÂ clinic escortsÂ told CNN.Â The clinic escorts volunteer to help patients and staffers avoid harassment or danger as they come and go from abortion facilities.
     
            The crowded lots and farther parking distances have made their role extra important, especially as anti-abortion activism has also ramped up, said Ryan Moran, a clinic escort who has been volunteering for years.
     
            âItâs a struggle to try to cluster all these appointments before May 1 to get people the care they need,â he said.
     
            On Wednesday, at least a half-dozen anti-abortion activistsÂ had stationed themselves behind the Jacksonville clinic, with regular trips up and down the parking lot, making beelines for parking cars that couldÂ haveÂ patients in them.
     
            Floridaâs new six-week ban is a âlandmark for the pro-life movement and for women,â said one person who asked to be identified as Wayne. âToday, we see this as a victory for all women. Itâs not a victory for us in any way.â
     
            By 11 a.m. Tuesday,Â the last day when abortions up to 15 weeks were allowed in Florida, all of the patientsÂ who had appointments for the day at A Womanâs ChoiceÂ in JacksonvilleÂ were checked in,Â and the parking lot was full once again,Â with a half-dozen clinic escorts with big rainbow umbrellas and a sheriffâs patrol car scattered throughout. The parking lot emptied a little slower than usual throughout the afternoon, as the busy day had the clinic running a few hours behind schedule.
     
            Florida law requires that people seeking an abortion have an in-person visit for an ultrasound, lab work and meeting with a physician at least 24 hours before their appointment to receive the procedure or medication. Sometimes, patients wait weeks to come back for their second appointment â in some cases, itâs so long that the lab work expires and the process has to start over again. But over the past couple of days, with the new ban looming, more patients showed up for their second appointments to be sure they made it in time.
     
            The last day before the new ban took effect may have seemed like business as usual. Up and down the clinicâs bright yellow hallways dotted with inspirational quotes, patients waited behind closed doors for their appointments. They met medical staff in exam rooms or sat in leather reclining chairs with heating pads to recover.
     
            But the work to get to that point has been months in the making.
     
            The Florida Supreme Court issued the decision that paved the way for the six-week ban on April 1, just 30 days before it took effect. A Womanâs Choice often schedules appointments a few weeks out, so alternate plans had to be made for some patients almost as soon as the decision was made public.
     
            All of that coordination happens in the call center across the parking lot from the clinic, where a few operators answer a near-constant stream of calls from people trying to understand their options and schedule appointments across the five clinics that A Womanâs Choice has: the Jacksonville location; three in North Carolina, where abortion is legal through 12 weeks; and one in Virginia, where there are no restrictions.
     
            Having this network of clinics in locations with different laws lets workers in the call center make real-time adjustments to help patients find the best option for their situation, said Gabby Long, the hotline director for A Womanâs Choice.
     
            âHaving that direct line makes it easier on patients,â she said. âWhen you go to a place you kind of already know, you donât have to say, âOh, I donât know where to call. I donât know where to go. What is my next move?ââ
     
            Communicating with patients about the new ban in Florida has been disheartening, but managing what it means for patients and how they might feel is nothing new, Long said.
     
            âI feel like we were more prepared for this just because weâve seen so much change,â she said. âMy biggest thing was my girls in the call center â itâs just humanity. Just be mindful of patients. Put yourself in their shoes. Because we know that our patients are stressed. We know theyâre scared. They just want to have access to basic health care. But there are always options for our patients.â
     
            Sometimes, that option might mean coordinating care for patients at the Virginia location and helping them access abortion funds to help them make the 500-mile trip from Jacksonville.
     
            The Virginia clinic just opened in February; itâs so new that the address, just a few miles across the stateâs southernmost border, isnât yet included on much of the printed material that can be found around the offices.
     
            But opening that clinic was in direct anticipation of stricter laws in Florida and planning for it started âas soon as we knew [state law] was being challenged,â said Terry Sallas Merritt, an executive team member at A Womanâs Choice.
     
            On Wednesday, when the new ban took effect, three patients who had their initial consultation at the Jacksonville location of A Womanâs Choice learned that they were past the new gestational limit in the state and would have to travel out of state to get an abortion.
     
            One patient was about eight weeks along, and two were just over six weeks, Kelly Flynn, president and chief executive officer of A Womanâs Choice, told CNN. The clinic helped one patient schedule an appointment for an abortionÂ inÂ North Carolina, and the other two connected with patient navigators to help them find funding and other resources for an out-of-state trip.
     
            âThatâs the majority of our patients. They donât know the exact time they got pregnant,â Flynn said. âIf they werenât previously [aware of the new ban], they are now.â
     
            The battle over abortion in Florida continues, as itâs one of at least three states that have an abortion-related measure on the November ballot.
     
            But for now, the focus remains on individual patients.
     
            âWe are going to continue to stay open,â Flynn said. âThe biggest hurdle right now is just to get patients in the door that need an abortion, get their consent process started and then help them navigate the way to the option they choose.â

            On Tuesday afternoon, Mikenzie Buchanan scooped up an armful of clipboards piled behind the front desk at A Womanâs Choice, an abortion clinic here; it was almost too many to hold. On each clipboard, behind a blue cover to protect personal information, were documents and charts for patients who had visited the clinic to receive a medication abortion that day.
     
            âStarting tomorrow, I will be making a lot less of these,â said Buchanan, who has been working at the front desk for a few months.
     
            Over the past couple of days, the Jacksonville clinic had been seeing two to four times as many patients as it typically would. But today, May 1, a significant shift in Floridaâs abortion law takes effect, cutting the 15-week ban down to a six-week ban â a time before many womenÂ know theyâre pregnant.
     
            The new restrictions will reverberate through the state and the broader region, as Florida has become a key abortion access point for the South in the years since the US Supreme Courtâs Dobbs decision revoked the federal right to an abortion.
     
            Buchanan is often the first person people see when they arrive for their appointments. Some patients who come in arenât familiar with the new six-week ban, but many are worried and stressed about âbeating the clock,â she said. âI feel a sense of urgency, too. I donât want to add any stress to it. But behind the scenes, weâre definitely making sure that they can be seen as quickly as possible and get where they need to go.â
     
            Candace, a Jacksonville resident and 36-year-old mother of two, learned about Floridaâs six-week ban when she called A Womanâs Choice to make an appointment for an abortion. She was within that limit when she had her appointment on Tuesday but worries about what it means for the future, including for her teenage daughter.
     
            âI feel relieved to be able to get in, and I feel lucky that, you know, right now, I do have a voice, and I have a right over my own body. But waking up tomorrow â itâs devastating. I know my daughter and myself are waking up tomorrow with less rights than we do today,â she said.Â The newÂ time limitÂ raisesÂ fear in Candace,Â who has experienced high-risk pregnancies andÂ traumatic births,Â including the death of a newborn.Â Now, she worries that sheâsÂ at even greaterÂ riskÂ since sheâs older than 35.
     
            âIâm terrified,â she said. âMy life matters.â
     
            Candace said she would have preferred to get a surgical abortion but opted for medication abortion to leave space for the many women who may need to travel from other states.
     
            Last year, nearly 8,000 people traveled from out of state to receive an abortion in Florida, according to data from the state health department â thatâs nearly a tenth of all abortions that happened in the state and three times more than five years ago. After the Dobbs decision, nine of the 16 states in the South banned abortion. Florida now joins Georgia and South Carolina with a six-week ban. This leaves just three states in this US Census region â Delaware, Maryland and Virginia â where abortion remains legal past the first trimester and North Carolina with a 12-week limit.
     
            The parking lot behind the single-story gray building that houses the A Womanâs Choice clinic in Jacksonville had been full for weeks leading up to the new ban,Â and some patients had to park in neighboring lots,Â a group ofÂ clinic escortsÂ told CNN.Â The clinic escorts volunteer to help patients and staffers avoid harassment or danger as they come and go from abortion facilities.
     
            The crowded lots and farther parking distances have made their role extra important, especially as anti-abortion activism has also ramped up, said Ryan Moran, a clinic escort who has been volunteering for years.
     
            âItâs a struggle to try to cluster all these appointments before May 1 to get people the care they need,â he said.
     
            On Wednesday, at least a half-dozen anti-abortion activistsÂ had stationed themselves behind the Jacksonville clinic, with regular trips up and down the parking lot, making beelines for parking cars that couldÂ haveÂ patients in them.
     
            Floridaâs new six-week ban is a âlandmark for the pro-life movement and for women,â said one person who asked to be identified as Wayne. âToday, we see this as a victory for all women. Itâs not a victory for us in any way.â
     
            By 11 a.m. Tuesday,Â the last day when abortions up to 15 weeks were allowed in Florida, all of the patientsÂ who had appointments for the day at A Womanâs ChoiceÂ in JacksonvilleÂ were checked in,Â and the parking lot was full once again,Â with a half-dozen clinic escorts with big rainbow umbrellas and a sheriffâs patrol car scattered throughout. The parking lot emptied a little slower than usual throughout the afternoon, as the busy day had the clinic running a few hours behind schedule.
     
            Florida law requires that people seeking an abortion have an in-person visit for an ultrasound, lab work and meeting with a physician at least 24 hours before their appointment to receive the procedure or medication. Sometimes, patients wait weeks to come back for their second appointment â in some cases, itâs so long that the lab work expires and the process has to start over again. But over the past couple of days, with the new ban looming, more patients showed up for their second appointments to be sure they made it in time.
     
            The last day before the new ban took effect may have seemed like business as usual. Up and down the clinicâs bright yellow hallways dotted with inspirational quotes, patients waited behind closed doors for their appointments. They met medical staff in exam rooms or sat in leather reclining chairs with heating pads to recover.
     
            But the work to get to that point has been months in the making.
     
            The Florida Supreme Court issued the decision that paved the way for the six-week ban on April 1, just 30 days before it took effect. A Womanâs Choice often schedules appointments a few weeks out, so alternate plans had to be made for some patients almost as soon as the decision was made public.
     
            All of that coordination happens in the call center across the parking lot from the clinic, where a few operators answer a near-constant stream of calls from people trying to understand their options and schedule appointments across the five clinics that A Womanâs Choice has: the Jacksonville location; three in North Carolina, where abortion is legal through 12 weeks; and one in Virginia, where there are no restrictions.
     
            Having this network of clinics in locations with different laws lets workers in the call center make real-time adjustments to help patients find the best option for their situation, said Gabby Long, the hotline director for A Womanâs Choice.
     
            âHaving that direct line makes it easier on patients,â she said. âWhen you go to a place you kind of already know, you donât have to say, âOh, I donât know where to call. I donât know where to go. What is my next move?ââ
     
            Communicating with patients about the new ban in Florida has been disheartening, but managing what it means for patients and how they might feel is nothing new, Long said.
     
            âI feel like we were more prepared for this just because weâve seen so much change,â she said. âMy biggest thing was my girls in the call center â itâs just humanity. Just be mindful of patients. Put yourself in their shoes. Because we know that our patients are stressed. We know theyâre scared. They just want to have access to basic health care. But there are always options for our patients.â
     
            Sometimes, that option might mean coordinating care for patients at the Virginia location and helping them access abortion funds to help them make the 500-mile trip from Jacksonville.
     
            The Virginia clinic just opened in February; itâs so new that the address, just a few miles across the stateâs southernmost border, isnât yet included on much of the printed material that can be found around the offices.

            Women are now advised to get a mammogram every other year starting at age 40 and until age 74, according to new recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force.
     
            TheÂ USPSTF, a volunteer panel of independent medical experts whose recommendations help guide doctorsâ decisions and influence insurance plans,Â previously recommended that biennial mammograms start by age 50 and the decision for women to screen in their 40s âshould be an individual one.â
     
            These new recommendations, published Tuesday in the medical journal JAMA, replace the task forceâs 2016 recommendations. Some groups, such as the American Cancer Society, have already recommended for women to start mammograms in their 40s.
     
            The updated USPSTF recommendations apply to everyone assigned female at birth, including cisgender women, transgender men and nonbinary people at average risk of breast cancer, as well as those with a family history of breast cancer or dense breasts.
     
            The updated recommendations do not apply to people with a personal history of breast cancer, a genetic marker or syndrome that may put them at a high risk of breast cancer, such as the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes, or those with a history of high-dose radiation therapy to the chest or a history of a high-risk breast lesions. These patients should either stay on the plan outlined by their physician or talk to their doctor about whatâs best for them.
     
            âWe make this new updated recommendation because the latest science clearly shows that starting at age 40 and obtaining a mammogram every other year until age 74 can further reduce deaths in breast cancer,â saidÂ USPSTF Chair Dr. Wanda Nicholson, a senior associate dean and professor atÂ George Washington Universityâs Milken Institute School of Public Health.
     
            The benefit of screening for breast cancer is that it can help diagnose cases early, before the cancer has spread, which reduces the risk of dying from the disease.
     
            Breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women in the United States, after skin cancer, and itâs the second-leading cause of cancer death, after lung cancer.
     
            âWe can save even more lives â up to nearly 20% more lives â with this updated strategy,â Nicholson said about the new recommendations.
     
            About 1 in 8 women will develop invasive breast cancer in their lifetime, according to the American Cancer Society, and mammography âÂ taking an X-ray of the breast â remains the best tool to screen for and detect the disease.
     
            The USPSTF has received some criticism for recommending to screen every other year, and not annually.
     
            âUsing USPSTF terminology, annual screening is just as âefficientâ as biennial screening but produces greater overall reductions in late-stage disease and deaths due to breast cancer, and greater gains in years of life saved,â Dr. Wendie Berg, of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, wrote in an editorial published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Oncology. She added that âit is surprisingâ the USPSTF recommends biennial rather than annual screening.
     
            âThe updated USPSTF recommendations are an important step forward, but they stop short. Annual mammography is as efficient as biennial mammography but with greater overall gains in years of life saved,â Berg wrote. âAnnual screening is particularly important for premenopausal women, especially women in racial and ethnic minority groups.â
     
            Along with recommending biennial screening, there are other concerns around how the USPSTF makes blanket recommendations for people at average risk as well as those with a family history of breast cancer or dense breasts, said Molly Guthrie, vice president of policy and advocacy at the breast cancer foundation Susan G. Komen.
     
            About half of women older than 40 in the United States have dense breast tissue, according to the US Food and Drug Administration, which last year updated mammography regulations to require that all US screening facilities notify patients about the density of their breasts with their mammography results.
     
            âWe were really surprised to see how they broke out their intended audiences and it doesnât reflect what is standard today as far as identifying those people that are at high risk of breast cancer,â Guthrie said. âI fear that thatâs going just to further muddy the water on what people are supposed to do.â
     
            Some experts say that people with a direct family history of breast cancer or with dense breasts should have different screening recommendations, as both factors have been associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Thatâs why, Guthrie said, itâs best for women to have conversations with their doctors about their own personal medical and family history and what might be best for them individually.
     
            âThereâs been a lot of attention out there to these systems that are in place to evaluate peopleâs risk, and so having that conversation with your provider, youâll be able to determine your risk and the type and frequency of breast imaging you need,â Guthrie said.
     
            âThe good and bad thing about the task force guidelines is that theyâre directly tied to health plans having to cover this at no cost,â she said. And by not recommending annual screening, âwe worry that the updated recommendation will drive down access and utilization of screening, meaning that weâre going to see, likely, a result of increased late-stage diagnosis, and thatâs when breast cancer is harder to treat and much more expensive for the health care system as a whole.â
     
            In their review of published research and data, USPSTF members found no evidence to support screening annually, Nicholson said.
     
            âCurrently thereâs no randomized trials comparing annual screening to every-other-year screening. However, as part of our systematic evidence review, which is part of all of our recommendation data, we did find evidence that if you compare screening every other year to annually, you do not have an increase in later-stage diagnosis of breast cancers,â Nicholson said.
     
            âWhen we looked at our modeling studies to assess the balance of benefits and harms, thereâs a much more favorable balance of benefits and harms with every-other-year screening compared to annual screening,â she said. âWith annual screening, you had a 50% higher rate of false positive results.â
     
            False positive results for breast cancer mean a mammogram may have been identified as abnormal when there is no cancer present. That can lead to patients needing additional biopsies, repeated tests and enduring psychological stress.
     
            âGetting screened every other year maximizes the benefit of screening while minimizing related harms. These harms can include being told you might have cancer when you donât â or being told you donât have cancer when you do, as well as receiving treatment that was not needed,â according to a patient fact sheet from the USPSTF.
     
            The USPSTFâs shift from saying women should make individualized screening decisions in their 40s to women should start screening at age 40 appears to align more closely with what some other organizations have recommended for some time.
     
            The American Cancer Society recommends that women ages 40 to 44 have the option to screen with a mammogram every year, women 45 to 55 should get mammograms every year, and women 55 and older can switch to a schedule of mammograms every other year.
     
            âThe USPSTF decision today is a critical change concerning womenâs health and the fight against breast cancer, acknowledging that women in their 40s will benefit from mammography screening, and sending a strong message to referring physicians and women that breast cancer screening should begin earlier than age 50,â Dr. Karen Knudsen, chief executive officer at the American Cancer Society, said in part in a statement.
     
            âMammography screening is the cornerstone of our strategy to find this potentially deadly disease early, when itâs easier to treat successfully,â Knudsen added. âHowever, we are disappointed that the updated USPSTF screening recommendations do not include women over the age of 74. Millions of women over age 75 are in very good health and are expected to live many more years during which their risk of breast cancer remains high.â
     
            The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women at average risk of breast cancer screen every one to two years beginning at age 40, starting no later than age 50. Those recommendations say screening should continue until at least age 75.
     
            To help inform the updated screening recommendations, task force members analyzed data from seven randomized clinical trials and 13 nonrandomized studies, as well as a new modeling study.
     
            âWe were able to look at the balance of benefit and harms with regard to interval screening, and age to start screening,â Nicholson said.
     
            The USPSTF members found that biennial breast cancer screening in women ages 40 to 74 had a benefit of reducing the risk of dying from breast cancer. But the evidence was insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms for screening in women 75 or older. The task force also found the evidence to be insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of supplemental screening in women with dense breasts.
     
            The updated recommendation includes both traditional digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis or â3D mammographyâ as effective screening approaches.
     
            The USPSTFÂ reviewsÂ its recommendations every five years to either update or reaffirm them, Nicholson said, and the task force also âconsistentlyâ looks for new evidence to inform any updates.
     
            For the new recommendations, the USPSTF found âclear evidenceâ that showed that âthe incidence of invasive breast cancers in women ages 40 to 49 had been increasing by about 2% every year,â Nicholson said.
     
            âMore and more women in their 40s were being diagnosed with invasive breast cancers,â she said. âAnd for the first time we also had data on Black women, and we know that Black women are nearly 40% more likely to die from breast cancer compared to White women. So this was important, updated observational data that we had that did provide the data input for our collaborative modeling studies.â
     
            The updated USPSTF recommendations note that there are âpronounced inequitiesâ in breast cancer, and Black women compared with White women are more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages and more likely to die, despite being less likely to be diagnosed with the disease overall.
     
            The task force called for ârigorous researchâ to better understand these inequities and identify ways to address them.
     
            âWe really need research to help us to better understand the underlying cause of why Black women may have more aggressive cancers compared to other women. It may be a combination of environmental exposure and social determinants of health,â Nicholson said.
     
            âSecondly, we need to know more about how to address these disparities. In other words, whatâs happening within our health care system,â she said. âThirdly, we need more studies on whatâs the best interval screening for Black women. The current science shows that Black women as well should start at age 40 and continue every other year to age 74. But I think we do need additional studies to look at whether there are different screening strategies that would be more helpful to Black women.â
     
            The revised USPSTF recommendations shed light on two major issues: addressing health inequities in breast cancer and ensuring all women can benefit from advances made in screening technologies, Dr. Joann Elmore of the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Dr. Christoph Lee of the University of Washington School of Medicine, wrote in a joint editorial published Tuesday in the journal JAMA.
     
            âEncouraging earlier screening starting at age 40 years represents just one facet of the breast care continuum. These assumptions include women accessing screening facilities with up-to-date technology, receiving prompt diagnostic evaluations, and accessing high-quality definitive treatmentâa reality that does not always hold, particularly for individuals belonging to groups and communities that are traditionally underserved and underresourced,â Elmore and Lee wrote.
     
            âOverall, the updated USPSTF recommendations highlight a rapidly evolving intersection of technology and equity within an already complex health care ecosystem in which disparities remain a persistent problem,â they wrote. âIt is important that physicians continue to practice the art of medicine to ensure that women make informed decisions aligned with their preferences.â

Annual mammography is as efficient as biennial mammography but with greater overall gains in years of life saved,â Berg wrote. âAnnual screening is particularly important for premenopausal women, especially women in racial and ethnic minority groups.â
     
            Along with recommending biennial screening, there are other concerns around how the USPSTF makes blanket recommendations for people at average risk as well as those with a family history of breast cancer or dense breasts, said Molly Guthrie, vice president of policy and advocacy at the breast cancer foundation Susan G. Komen.
     
            About half of women older than 40 in the United States have dense breast tissue, according to the US Food and Drug Administration, which last year updated mammography regulations to require that all US screening facilities notify patients about the density of their breasts with their mammography results.
     
            âWe were really surprised to see how they broke out their intended audiences and it doesnât reflect what is standard today as far as identifying those people that are at high risk of breast cancer,â Guthrie said. âI fear that thatâs going just to further muddy the water on what people are supposed to do.â
     
            Some experts say that people with a direct family history of breast cancer or with dense breasts should have different screening recommendations, as both factors have been associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer. Thatâs why, Guthrie said, itâs best for women to have conversations with their doctors about their own personal medical and family history and what might be best for them individually.
     
            âThereâs been a lot of attention out there to these systems that are in place to evaluate peopleâs risk, and so having that conversation with your provider, youâll be able to determine your risk and the type and frequency of breast imaging you need,â Guthrie said.
     
            âThe good and bad thing about the task force guidelines is that theyâre directly tied to health plans having to cover this at no cost,â she said. And by not recommending annual screening, âwe worry that the updated recommendation will drive down access and utilization of screening, meaning that weâre going to see, likely, a result of increased late-stage diagnosis, and thatâs when breast cancer is harder to treat and much more expensive for the health care system as a whole.â
     
            In their review of published research and data, USPSTF members found no evidence to support screening annually, Nicholson said.
     
            âCurrently thereâs no randomized trials comparing annual screening to every-other-year screening. However, as part of our systematic evidence review, which is part of all of our recommendation data, we did find evidence that if you compare screening every other year to annually, you do not have an increase in later-stage diagnosis of breast cancers,â Nicholson said.
     
            âWhen we looked at our modeling studies to assess the balance of benefits and harms, thereâs a much more favorable balance of benefits and harms with every-other-year screening compared to annual screening,â she said. âWith annual screening, you had a 50% higher rate of false positive results.â
     
            False positive results for breast cancer mean a mammogram may have been identified as abnormal when there is no cancer present. That can lead to patients needing additional biopsies, repeated tests and enduring psychological stress.
     
            âGetting screened every other year maximizes the benefit of screening while minimizing related harms. These harms can include being told you might have cancer when you donât â or being told you donât have cancer when you do, as well as receiving treatment that was not needed,â according to a patient fact sheet from the USPSTF.
     
            The USPSTFâs shift from saying women should make individualized screening decisions in their 40s to women should start screening at age 40 appears to align more closely with what some other organizations have recommended for some time.
     
            The American Cancer Society recommends that women ages 40 to 44 have the option to screen with a mammogram every year, women 45 to 55 should get mammograms every year, and women 55 and older can switch to a schedule of mammograms every other year.
     
            âThe USPSTF decision today is a critical change concerning womenâs health and the fight against breast cancer, acknowledging that women in their 40s will benefit from mammography screening, and sending a strong message to referring physicians and women that breast cancer screening should begin earlier than age 50,â Dr. Karen Knudsen, chief executive officer at the American Cancer Society, said in part in a statement.
     
            âMammography screening is the cornerstone of our strategy to find this potentially deadly disease early, when itâs easier to treat successfully,â Knudsen added. âHowever, we are disappointed that the updated USPSTF screening recommendations do not include women over the age of 74. Millions of women over age 75 are in very good health and are expected to live many more years during which their risk of breast cancer remains high.â
     
            The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women at average risk of breast cancer screen every one to two years beginning at age 40, starting no later than age 50. Those recommendations say screening should continue until at least age 75.
     
            To help inform the updated screening recommendations, task force members analyzed data from seven randomized clinical trials and 13 nonrandomized studies, as well as a new modeling study.
     
            âWe were able to look at the balance of benefit and harms with regard to interval screening, and age to start screening,â Nicholson said.
     
            The USPSTF members found that biennial breast cancer screening in women ages 40 to 74 had a benefit of reducing the risk of dying from breast cancer. But the evidence was insufficient to determine the balance of benefits and harms for screening in women 75 or older. The task force also found the evidence to be insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of supplemental screening in women with dense breasts.
     
            The updated recommendation includes both traditional digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis or â3D mammographyâ as effective screening approaches.
     
            The USPSTFÂ reviewsÂ its recommendations every five years to either update or reaffirm them, Nicholson said, and the task force also âconsistentlyâ looks for new evidence to inform any updates.
     
            For the new recommendations, the USPSTF found âclear evidenceâ that showed that âthe incidence of invasive breast cancers in women ages 40 to 49 had been increasing by about 2% every year,â Nicholson said.
     
            âMore and more women in their 40s were being diagnosed with invasive breast cancers,â she said. âAnd for the first time we also had data on Black women, and we know that Black women are nearly 40% more likely to die from breast cancer compared to White women. So this was important, updated observational data that we had that did provide the data input for our collaborative modeling studies.â
     
            The updated USPSTF recommendations note that there are âpronounced inequitiesâ in breast cancer, and Black women compared with White women are more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages and more likely to die, despite being less likely to be diagnosed with the disease overall.
     
            The task force called for ârigorous researchâ to better understand these inequities and identify ways to address them.
     
            âWe really need research to help us to better understand the underlying cause of why Black women may have more aggressive cancers compared to other women. It may be a combination of environmental exposure and social determinants of health,â Nicholson said.
     
            âSecondly, we need to know more about how to address these disparities. In other words, whatâs happening within our health care system,â she said. âThirdly, we need more studies on whatâs the best interval screening for Black women. The current science shows that Black women as well should start at age 40 and continue every other year to age 74. But I think we do need additional studies to look at whether there are different screening strategies that would be more helpful to Black women.â
     
            The revised USPSTF recommendations shed light on two major issues: addressing health inequities in breast cancer and ensuring all women can benefit from advances made in screening technologies, Dr. Joann Elmore of the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles, and Dr. Christoph Lee of the University of Washington School of Medicine, wrote in a joint editorial published Tuesday in the journal JAMA.
     
            âEncouraging earlier screening starting at age 40 years represents just one facet of the breast care continuum. These assumptions include women accessing screening facilities with up-to-date technology, receiving prompt diagnostic evaluations, and accessing high-quality definitive treatmentâa reality that does not always hold, particularly for individuals belonging to groups and communities that are traditionally underserved and underresourced,â Elmore and Lee wrote.
     
            âOverall, the updated USPSTF recommendations highlight a rapidly evolving intersection of technology and equity within an already complex health care ecosystem in which disparities remain a persistent problem,â they wrote. âIt is important that physicians continue to practice the art of medicine to ensure that women make informed decisions aligned with their preferences.â

            The Biden administration moved Tuesday to reclassify marijuï»¿ana as a lower-risk substance, a person familiar with the plans told CNN, a historic move that acknowledges the medical benefits of the long-criminalized drug and carries broad implications for cannabis-related research and the industry at large.
     
            The US Department of Justice recommended that marijuana be rescheduled as a Schedule III controlled substance, a classification shared by prescription drugs such as ketamine and Tylenol with codeine.
     
            âToday, [Attorney General Merrick Garland] circulated a proposal to reclassify marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III,â Xochitl Hinojosa, the DOJâs director of public affairs, said in a statement. âOnce published by the Federal Register, it will initiate a formal rulemaking process as prescribed by Congress in the Controlled Substances Act.â
     
            The formal rulemaking process is lengthy, typically includes a public comment period and could take months to complete.
     
            The rescheduling recommendation, which was first reported Tuesday by the Associated Press, was hailed by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, including Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina, who touted it on X as âmajor news for businesses, tax deductions & research barriers.â
     
            Democrat Rep. Earl Blumenauer of Oregon said in a statement that rescheduling is âone step closer to ending the failed war on drugs.â
     
            For more than 50 years, marijuana has been categorized as a Schedule I substance â drugs like heroin, bath salts and ecstasy that are considered to have no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse â and subject to the strictest of restrictions.
     
            The expected recommendation comes after the US Health and Human Services department, following a thorough US Food and Drug Administration review at the direction of President Joe Biden, who in 2022 sent a letter to the Justice Department supporting the reclassification to Schedule III.
     
            Last fall, members of the FDAâs Controlled Substance Staff wrote in the documents that the agency recommended rescheduling marijuana because it meets three criteria: a lower potential for abuse than other substances on Schedules I and II; a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the US; and a risk of low or moderate physical dependence in people who abuse it. The National Institute on Drug Abuse concurred with the recommendation.
     
            Although marijuana has a âhigh prevalence of non-medical useâ in the US, it doesnât seem to elicit serious outcomes, compared with drugs such as heroin, oxycodone and cocaine, the researchers said. âThis is especially notable given the availabilityâ of products that contain very high levels of Delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary active compound in cannabis.
     
            Since the first adult-use cannabis sale took place in 2014 in Colorado, cannabis has blossomed into a multibillion-dollar industry that has attracted the attention of multinational companies across sectors such as alcohol, agriculture, pharmaceutical and tobacco.
     
            Cannabis, and specifically how it is viewed by the public and politicians, has undergone a sea-change during the past decade.
     
            Currently, 24 states, two territories and DC have legalized cannabis for adult recreational use, and 38 states allow medical use of cannabis products, according to data from the National Conference of State Legislatures. State-licensed cannabis dispensaries and retail shops are expected to generate $32.1 billion in sales this year, according to estimates from MJBiz, a cannabis industry trade publication and events organizer.
     
            Public sentiment has ballooned: In November, a record 70% of Americans surveyed by Gallup said they supported cannabis legalization. In 2014, that share was 51%.
     
            US lawmakers have warmed up to the plant as well, drafting scores of cannabis-related bills, including those seeking to remove marijuana entirely from the Controlled Substances Act while preserving the state-run markets.
     
            Moving marijuana out of Schedule I could open more avenues for research; ease some of the more harshly punitive criminal consequences; potentially allow cannabis businesses to bank more freely and openly; and, perhaps most significantly for state-licensed operators, result in firms no longer being subjected to a 40-year-old tax code that disallows credits and deductions from income generated by sales of Schedule I and II substances.
     
            However, rescheduling marijuana will not solve that federal-state conflict, the Congressional Research Service noted in a January 16 brief. The manufacture, distribution and possession of recreational marijuana would remain illegal under federal law and possibly subject to enforcement and prosecution regardless of the stateâs legality, the CRS wrote.
     
            âOutside of the tax implications, this is monumentally symbolic,â Andrew Freedman, the former Colorado cannabis czar who now serves as executive director of the Coalition for Cannabis Policy, Education and Regulation, told CNN in an interview. âIt is rare for the federal government to reverse itself on an issue where itâs had a stance for the last 100 years and arrested countless people for.â
     
            States with medical marijuana programs do currently have some federal protections in place via appropriations legislation that restricts the Justice Department from interfering in those programs. Schedule III status will not affect that rider, the CRS said.
     
            The 2018 Agriculture Improvement Act, better known as the Farm Bill, defined and decontrolled hemp and hemp-derived cannabidiol and removed it from the definition of marijuana â and from regulatory control â under the Controlled Substances Act. The FDAâs scientific and medical evaluation of marijuana did not address products containing plant-derived cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD.

"
            Spikes of influenza A virus seen in wastewater samples from 59 sewer systems across 18 different states this spring may point to the spread of the H5N1 avian influenza virus that is currently infecting dairy cattle, a new study suggests.
     
            So far, the US Department of Agriculture has reported more than 30 herds of dairy cows infected with H5N1 influenza across nine states. But there are questions about how large the outbreak might be and whether the US can adequately track it.
     
            In a news conference last week, USDA officials admitted that itâs been difficult to get milk producers to let them test for the infection.Â Recent tests of milk purchased at grocery stores found genetic material from the H5N1 virus in 1 out of 5 samples tested, though further testing showed the virus fragments detected in milk were not infectious.
     
            Last week, in a multi-agency news conference on the governmentâs response to the spreading virus, Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the agency was looking at whether it might be feasible to use wastewater to pinpoint areas where the virus is spreading. First, he said, scientists would need to develop a test that could distinguish H5 influenza from the larger soup of circulating A-strain flu viruses.
     
            Now scientists at Emory, Stanford and Verily Life Sciences, a research organizationÂ affiliated with the WastewaterSCAN network that monitors a large network of wastewater treatment plants across the US, say they have done just that.
     
            Wastewater testing is a passive way of tracking the spread of infections.Â  It doesnât depend on people or animals to be swabbed to test for pathogens.Â  Instead, evidence flows into the wastewater every time a toilet is flushed or someone dumps material down a drain.
     
            Out of 190 wastewater treatment plants that currently monitor sludge samples for influenza A, 59 saw increases of the A-strain viruses this spring, just as human flu cases were flat or falling.Â Wastewater experts wondered if it might be from H5N1, the highly pathogenic avian influenza infections in dairy cattle or other animals.
     
            The WastewaterSCANÂ team developed a test to check for the flu virusâ H5 gene and used it on stored samples fromÂ sewer systems near areas in Texas where dairy cattle had tested positive, but not including wastewater directly from the farms.
     
            The team measured both a genetic marker for influenza A viruses and genetic markers specific to H5 viruses.
     
            As levels of the marker for influenza A viruses began to rise in early March, the markers for the H5 viruses began to rise in tandem. Â The concentration of the H5 gene in the samples was nearly as high as the concentration of the influenza A viruses overall, suggesting that a large fraction of the viruses in the samples were H5N1.
     
            Whatâs more, the concentrations of influenza A viruses measured in these wastewater sludge samples from the Amarillo, Texas, area were âamong the highest ever measured in wastewater,â the study noted.
     
            The stored sludge samples tested for the study were taken between February 4 and April 16 at two treatment plants sites in the City of Amarillo watershed, and a third wastewater treatment plant in Dallas County. The researchers confirmedÂ wastewater processing plants sampled in the Amarillo area permitted some producers to dispose of animal byproducts, including dumped milk from dairies, which may explain the high concentrations of influenza A viruses, and H5 viruses in their samples.
     
            Just as wastewater testing has proven to be a harbinger of rising Covid-19 infections in the past, researchers say their study suggests it could be an early warning for bird flu outbreaks in farm animals, too.
     
            âWe detected the H5 marker right before there was confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza in those counties,â said Dr. Alexandria Boehm, who is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University.
     
            âI think that is super interesting. It means that the wastewater in this particular case, with this particular pathogen, can reveal information about what was circulating in these cattle before there was information publicly available,â Boehm said.
     
            The paper wasÂ posted as a preprintÂ on the BioRxiv server, ahead of rigorous review by outside experts.Â The researchers say they are working to get it published in a scientific journal.
     
            The study authors stress that no H5N1 outbreaks in cows have been reported in any of the sewersheds they tested.Â  Instead, they think that the permitted dumping of milk likely caused the big spikes in H5 virus they saw in early March.
     
            The researchers note that they canât rule out that the H5 genetic material theyâre picking up in the wastewater is all from dairy cattle. It could also be from birds or even humans.
     
            The researchers say they also donât have enough information to know where the increases in influeza A virus are coming from across multiple states.
     
            âWe donât know the answer to that question. It is something that I think needs to be followed up on,â Boehm said.
     
            But if the spike in viruses is from dumped milk or other animal waste across the sewersheds they monitor â and thatâs still a pretty big if â it means the outbreak is likely far more widespread than is currently known.
     
            âIf dairy industry activities in these sewersheds are a primary source of H5 in wastewater, this suggests that there may be additional, unidentified outbreaks among cattle with milk sent to these facilities since milk from infected animals is required to be diverted from the food supply,â the study authors note.
     
            But the researchers also say their results should be interpreted carefully.Â  Without tracking down possible sources in the sewersheds they monitor, the source of the virus canât be proven.

            The researchers say their testing method is very sensitive.Â It can detect even small amounts of the genetic material from the H5 viruses, but they canât tell if the viruses would be able to infect people and make them sick.

            The US Food and Drug Administration said last week that it has been testing samples of pasteurized milk in which traces of the H5N1 virus have been detected and so far found the milk is not infectious and cannot make people sick. 
     
            The wastewater researchers acknowledge that itâs also possible that their tests are picking up other types of H5 viruses, including low-pathogenic H5 influenza viruses, but they say these are not expected to be circulating in these areas at this time.
     
            âThis is a situation where we really felt like we were ethically bound to share this information with colleagues through a preprint and get the conversation going, because there are unanswered questions that are really important to answer,â Boehm said.

            Spikes of influenza A virus seen in wastewater samples from 59 sewer systems across 18 different states this spring may point to the spread of the H5N1 avian influenza virus that is currently infecting dairy cattle, a new study suggests.
     
            So far, the US Department of Agriculture has reported more than 30 herds of dairy cows infected with H5N1 influenza across nine states. But there are questions about how large the outbreak might be and whether the US can adequately track it.
     
            In a news conference last week, USDA officials admitted that itâs been difficult to get milk producers to let them test for the infection.Â Recent tests of milk purchased at grocery stores found genetic material from the H5N1 virus in 1 out of 5 samples tested, though further testing showed the virus fragments detected in milk were not infectious.
     
            Last week, in a multi-agency news conference on the governmentâs response to the spreading virus, Dr. Nirav Shah, principal deputy director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the agency was looking at whether it might be feasible to use wastewater to pinpoint areas where the virus is spreading. First, he said, scientists would need to develop a test that could distinguish H5 influenza from the larger soup of circulating A-strain flu viruses.
     
            Now scientists at Emory, Stanford and Verily Life Sciences, a research organizationÂ affiliated with the WastewaterSCAN network that monitors a large network of wastewater treatment plants across the US, say they have done just that.
     
            Wastewater testing is a passive way of tracking the spread of infections.Â  It doesnât depend on people or animals to be swabbed to test for pathogens.Â  Instead, evidence flows into the wastewater every time a toilet is flushed or someone dumps material down a drain.
     
            Out of 190 wastewater treatment plants that currently monitor sludge samples for influenza A, 59 saw increases of the A-strain viruses this spring, just as human flu cases were flat or falling.Â Wastewater experts wondered if it might be from H5N1, the highly pathogenic avian influenza infections in dairy cattle or other animals.
     
            The WastewaterSCANÂ team developed a test to check for the flu virusâ H5 gene and used it on stored samples fromÂ sewer systems near areas in Texas where dairy cattle had tested positive, but not including wastewater directly from the farms.
     
            The team measured both a genetic marker for influenza A viruses and genetic markers specific to H5 viruses.
     
            As levels of the marker for influenza A viruses began to rise in early March, the markers for the H5 viruses began to rise in tandem. Â The concentration of the H5 gene in the samples was nearly as high as the concentration of the influenza A viruses overall, suggesting that a large fraction of the viruses in the samples were H5N1.
     
            Whatâs more, the concentrations of influenza A viruses measured in these wastewater sludge samples from the Amarillo, Texas, area were âamong the highest ever measured in wastewater,â the study noted.
     
            The stored sludge samples tested for the study were taken between February 4 and April 16 at two treatment plants sites in the City of Amarillo watershed, and a third wastewater treatment plant in Dallas County. The researchers confirmedÂ wastewater processing plants sampled in the Amarillo area permitted some producers to dispose of animal byproducts, including dumped milk from dairies, which may explain the high concentrations of influenza A viruses, and H5 viruses in their samples.
     
            Just as wastewater testing has proven to be a harbinger of rising Covid-19 infections in the past, researchers say their study suggests it could be an early warning for bird flu outbreaks in farm animals, too.
     
            âWe detected the H5 marker right before there was confirmed highly pathogenic avian influenza in those counties,â said Dr. Alexandria Boehm, who is a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University.
     
            âI think that is super interesting. It means that the wastewater in this particular case, with this particular pathogen, can reveal information about what was circulating in these cattle before there was information publicly available,â Boehm said.
     
            The paper wasÂ posted as a preprintÂ on the BioRxiv server, ahead of rigorous review by outside experts.Â The researchers say they are working to get it published in a scientific journal.
     
            The study authors stress that no H5N1 outbreaks in cows have been reported in any of the sewersheds they tested.Â  Instead, they think that the permitted dumping of milk likely caused the big spikes in H5 virus they saw in early March.
     
            The researchers note that they canât rule out that the H5 genetic material theyâre picking up in the wastewater is all from dairy cattle. It could also be from birds or even humans.
     
            The researchers say they also donât have enough information to know where the increases in influeza A virus are coming from across multiple states.
     
            âWe donât know the answer to that question. It is something that I think needs to be followed up on,â Boehm said.
     
            But if the spike in viruses is from dumped milk or other animal waste across the sewersheds they monitor â and thatâs still a pretty big if â it means the outbreak is likely far more widespread than is currently known.
     
            âIf dairy industry activities in these sewersheds are a primary source of H5 in wastewater, this suggests that there may be additional, unidentified outbreaks among cattle with milk sent to these facilities since milk from infected animals is required to be diverted from the food supply,â the study authors note.
     
            But the researchers also say their results should be interpreted carefully.Â  Without tracking down possible sources in the sewersheds they monitor, the source of the virus canât be proven.
     
            âHowever, multiple lines of evidence suggest animal sources,â the paper says.
     
            The researchers say their testing method is very sensitive.Â It can detect even small amounts of the genetic material from the H5 viruses, but they canât tell if the viruses would be able to infect people and make them sick.  Boehm says they didnât try to culture the virus to see if it could infect cells.

            Mom-to-be Stephanie Zuroski hopes she recognizes the signs of labor quickly, because the hospital where she plans to deliver her first child is more than an hour from her home in rural Elk County, Pennsylvania.
     
            Elk County is about 2Â½ hours outside Pittsburgh, nestled at the edge of the Allegheny National Forest. Zuroski grew up on a farm and is familiar with the tradeoffs that come with rural living.
     
            âI am accustomed to driving to get the things that I need,â said Zuroski, 32.
     
            What she didnât expect was the lack of labor and delivery units in the county, which means sheâll have to drive out-of-state to give birth in a hospital.
     
            âWhen I started looking into pregnancy and [obstetrician] care, I was shocked local hospitals werenât delivering babies,â Zuroski said.
     
            In February, the Penn Highlands Healthcare hospital system announced that it was ârealigning servicesâ and moving labor and delivery services from Penn Highlands ElkÂ â the only hospital in the county âÂ to its sister hospital Penn Highlands DuBois, about 30 miles south in Clearfield County, on May 1. The shift limits maternal health care options in the area, and could raise the risk of people delivering in riskier conditions â even at home or in their cars.
     
            New and expecting mothers would still be able to get scans, tests and exams at Penn Highlands Elk, but they will no longer be able to deliver there.
     
            âFor Penn Highlands Healthcare, this transition is about quality and reducing risk and not finances,â the health system said in aÂ written response to CNN.
     
            The hospital in DuBois has the only neonatal intensive care unit within 100 miles, according to Penn Highlands Healthcare, and is staffed to handle high-risk deliveries.
     
            âThe transition is designed to offer a higher level of care for mothers and newborns,â the health system said in aÂ news release.
     
            It added that the declining number of births at Penn Highlands Elk was another factor in the decision.
     
            âThe number of deliveries is declining in Elk County. The number of births decreased from 233 in 2013 to 170 in 2023. Approximately 100 patients from St. Marys and the surrounding communities have been delivering at Penn Highlands DuBois each year,â Penn Highlands Healthcare told CNN.
     
            The closure of the labor and delivery unit leaves five counties with limited access to a labor and delivery unit.Â Two of the counties, Forest and Cameron, are considered by maternal health nonprofit March of Dimes to be maternity care deserts:Â areas withoutÂ obstetric providersÂ and without a hospital or a birth center offering obstetric care.
     
            âThis is a devastating thing that is happening. Women are struggling to have access before, during and after their pregnancy journey,â said Barbara Roth, March of Dimes executive director of market impact in western Pennsylvania.
     
            âThe farther a woman travels to receive maternity care, the greater the risk of maternal morbidity and adverse infant outcomes, such as stillbirth and NICU admission. Furthermore, longer travel distances to care can cause financial strain on families and increased prenatal stress and anxiety,â March of Dimes says in aÂ report. âThe distance a woman must travel to access care becomes a critical factor during pregnancy, at the time of birth, and in the case of emergencies. Nationwide closures of birthing hospitals have contributed to increased distance and travel time to care, especially in rural areas.â
     
            Roth said the nonprofit advocates for the expansion of access âto doulas, midwives and telehealthâ and held an advocacy day at the Pennsylvania Capitol in March to raise awareness about maternal and infant health care concerns such as these access issues.
     
            âIn the state of Pennsylvania, women living in counties with the highest travel time could travel up to 42.7 miles, and thatâs about 57 minutes on average â¦ to reach their nearest birthing hospitals,â Roth said.
     
            Statewide, March of Dimes says, aboutÂ 7.5% of countiesÂ in Pennsylvania are maternity care deserts, and about 12% of women donât have access to a birth hospital within 30 minutes of them.
     
            Certified nurse midwife Lauren Narbey said the situation in Elk County is a familiar one.
     
            When WVU Medicine Uniontown Hospital in Fayette CountyÂ closed its birthing center in 2019, she saw âa huge increase in the number of patientsâ who drove 45 minutes or more to deliver their babies at Jefferson Hospital in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, where she has worked since 2018.
     
            âItâs a very high-risk area, not a lot of health care at all available,â Narbey said of Fayette County, which is on the border with West Virginia. âSo patients are now having to drive sometimes two hours to get to Labor and Delivery.â
     
            Uniontown Hospital has since announced that it is re-establishing its obstetric services.
     
            At her hospital, Narbey says, she has seen patients come in to deliver without any prenatal care, simply because of the distance to the hospital and the lack of resources or support at home â especially people with multiple children. Many of her patients ask to schedule inductions so they can avoid making the trek while in labor, she said.
     
            âThis patient population really wants scheduled inductions at 39 weeks, which is the earliest we can offer without any kind of really risky complication necessitating delivery before then. And they really do want that, because they want to be able to plan the trip. They want to be able to plan child care. They donât want to have their baby in the car on the way. So Iâve seen a huge uptick in people wanting an induction,â she said.
     
            Emily McGahey, a midwife and the clinical director atÂ The Midwife CenterÂ in Pittsburgh, said birth centers like hers also have clients who do their best to plan.
     
            âSometimes, our families will arrange a time to come in and have a baby, or sometimes, they will labor and then maybe move to a closer family member or friendâs home or get a hotel room closer by,â she said, adding that clients at the center are typically discharged hours after birth and return for a checkup within the first 72 hours.
     
            And thatâs just the patients who are able to plan ahead; many donât make it in time for their deliveries.
     
            âThat happens a lot for us,â Narbey said. âI mean, like a few times a month that patients will have babies at home or in the car and then theyâll just bring them in the ambulance, and then we just cross our fingers that theyâre not hemorrhaging when they get here because their placenta is still inside.â
     
            In Elk County, Nick Burdick, manager of the St. Marys Area Ambulance service, is preparing for the possibility that his team will be called upon to deliver babies more frequently and is working with Penn Highlands Elk to get up to speed on the latest labor and delivery technology.
     
            âWe are certainly all trained in labor and delivery, although itâs not something that we experience often. But with the news of this unit and service closing in our local hospital, weâre absolutely taking the opportunity to increase our training and get more experience in labor and delivery and neonatal care,â Burdick said. âSo we will be working with Penn Highlands Elk in taking labor and delivery training as well as advanced neonatal life support, so they are willing and definitely helping accommodate us in their transition and giving us the resources and the education to be able to care for the community.â
     
            Zack PontiousâÂ pregnant sister-in-law was due May 1, the day the unit at Penn Highlands Elk is set to close. But the baby came early, saving her the 45-minute drive to Penn Highlands DuBois, said Pontious,Â a member of theÂ RidgwayÂ Borough Council in Elk County.
     
            The new uncle says the council is limited as to what it can do to replace labor and delivery services in the area.
     
            âBoroughs provide services like trash pickup and snowplow. Weâre not really in the business of providing health care,â he said.
     
            After Penn Highlandsâ announcement, he and other local officials and business owners formed a group to with state representatives and come up with ways to support and incentivize the health care system to maintain its services in Elk County.Â 
     
            Despite their efforts, the system is still moving forward with its plan, frustrating Pontious, who moved to Elk County to be closer to family as he and his wife plan to start their own.
     
            âMy wife and I moved here, and she never thought that this was a concern that we would have to have: that weâd have to be fighting for womenâs services to be left in â not even our town â in our county,â he said.Â 
     
            In neighboring Cameron County, Commissioner Joshua Zucal said officials are also exploring options to offset the closure of Penn Highlands Elkâs labor and delivery unit, such as midwives to help with home births.
     
            âCameron County was never notified or brought into the loop that this was occurring. It was just something that we had to hear through the news of it happening,â he said.
     
            Zucal said itâs not just maternal health care that is taking a hit in rural Pennsylvania;Â some local doctorsâ and dental offices have also closed or relocated, and itâs hard for Cameron County to attract enough people to work for emergency response teams in the area.
     
            âThere are the basic needs communities must have, and we need to have access. Itâs not that we have lost all access, but you can see pieces of the puzzle falling apart,â he said.
     
            The county commissioner said he is focusing on the solutions to try to remain optimistic.
     
            âWhat are the things that we can implement to still have a thriving community, though there are challenges? How can we still focus on the quality of life that a rural community can offer? And then also the health and wellness aspects, that if youâre a healthy person, the amount of care that youâre going to need is much less than somebody whoâs unhealthy. So if we can create healthy communities, we wonât need such a crutch and be so reliant on these organizations that choose to do things such as closing maternity,â he said. âSo we just need to figure out solutions to take care of our own.â
     
            Many people think a birth, or birthing, center is the perfect solution for an area like Elk County. These centers â where people with low-risk pregnancies can deliver in aÂ home-like facility,Â with more autonomy over the experience â are designed to âprovide routine care and initiate emergency proceduresâ and must be positioned close enough to a hospital where women can get c-sections if they need, according to theÂ American Association of Birth Centers.
     
            âI think thatâs a really valuable resource that our community should look into,â Zuroski said. âItâs definitely a resource that I would consider using in the future.â
     
            Narbey, acknowledging her perspective as a midwife, also agrees.
     
            âThis is my biased opinion. I think midwives are part of the solution. Most women are low-risk, and we could staff a birthing center starting with three midwives, which is cheaper than an obstetrician, and midwives tend to be really good at connecting with their communities and meeting people in a culturally sensitive, appropriate trauma-informed perspective,â she said, adding that communities in Alaska, Montana and South Dakota are turning to this model as a solution.
     
            Health care wasnât at the front of Zuroskiâs mind when she moved to Elk County in her mid-20s. Now, the the environmental engineer said she feels a deep connection to the community.
     
            Itâs vibrant and green in the spring and summer and awash with fall color in the cooler months, and Zuroski says she was drawn to the area by the sky-scraping trees and the âbeautiful little mountain streams that hold wild trout populations.â
     
            âIâm willing to compromise and give up some things in order to stay here and live where Iâm happy,â she said.
     
            For now, Zuroski makes a 45-minute commute every four weeks to her appointments with a certified nurse midwife in Bradford, Pennsylvania, close to the New York state line.
     
            And when itâs time for the baby to come in August, she plans to pack up and head to Olean, New York, now one of the closest hospitals to her with a maternity ward.
     
            âTraveling far while in labor will be uncomfortable,â she said.
     
            McGahey says it is time for communities to step up to ensure that maternal health care remains accessible to families.
     
            âI think on a larger community level, we need to be advocating for us as a society to figure out how we value maternity care in our country because itâs not valued,â she said. âAs we can see, all of these maternity care deserts in our counties, across our state and the country, and this is leaving hundreds of thousands of families without care.
     
            âWhere you live and where you choose to raise your family shouldnât affect the quality of health care that you receive,â McGahey said. âAnd I think thatâs the biggest issue right now is how we continue to show families support and take good care of them.â
     
            Narbey agrees. âIn some cases, it can be a life-and-death situation, and that should never be the case. But unfortunately, your ZIP code determines more about your health outcomes than any other factor.â

            Uniontown Hospital has since announced that it is re-establishing its obstetric services.
     
            At her hospital, Narbey says, she has seen patients come in to deliver without any prenatal care, simply because of the distance to the hospital and the lack of resources or support at home â especially people with multiple children. Many of her patients ask to schedule inductions so they can avoid making the trek while in labor, she said.
     
            âThis patient population really wants scheduled inductions at 39 weeks, which is the earliest we can offer without any kind of really risky complication necessitating delivery before then. And they really do want that, because they want to be able to plan the trip. They want to be able to plan child care. They donât want to have their baby in the car on the way. So Iâve seen a huge uptick in people wanting an induction,â she said.
     
            Emily McGahey, a midwife and the clinical director atÂ The Midwife CenterÂ in Pittsburgh, said birth centers like hers also have clients who do their best to plan.
     
            âSometimes, our families will arrange a time to come in and have a baby, or sometimes, they will labor and then maybe move to a closer family member or friendâs home or get a hotel room closer by,â she said, adding that clients at the center are typically discharged hours after birth and return for a checkup within the first 72 hours.
     
            And thatâs just the patients who are able to plan ahead; many donât make it in time for their deliveries.
     
            âThat happens a lot for us,â Narbey said. âI mean, like a few times a month that patients will have babies at home or in the car and then theyâll just bring them in the ambulance, and then we just cross our fingers that theyâre not hemorrhaging when they get here because their placenta is still inside.â
     
            In Elk County, Nick Burdick, manager of the St. Marys Area Ambulance service, is preparing for the possibility that his team will be called upon to deliver babies more frequently and is working with Penn Highlands Elk to get up to speed on the latest labor and delivery technology.
     
            âWe are certainly all trained in labor and delivery, although itâs not something that we experience often. But with the news of this unit and service closing in our local hospital, weâre absolutely taking the opportunity to increase our training and get more experience in labor and delivery and neonatal care,â Burdick said. âSo we will be working with Penn Highlands Elk in taking labor and delivery training as well as advanced neonatal life support, so they are willing and definitely helping accommodate us in their transition and giving us the resources and the education to be able to care for the community.â
     
            Zack PontiousâÂ pregnant sister-in-law was due May 1, the day the unit at Penn Highlands Elk is set to close. But the baby came early, saving her the 45-minute drive to Penn Highlands DuBois, said Pontious,Â a member of theÂ RidgwayÂ Borough Council in Elk County.
     
            The new uncle says the council is limited as to what it can do to replace labor and delivery services in the area.
     
            âBoroughs provide services like trash pickup and snowplow. Weâre not really in the business of providing health care,â he said.
     
            After Penn Highlandsâ announcement, he and other local officials and business owners formed a group to with state representatives and come up with ways to support and incentivize the health care system to maintain its services in Elk County.Â 
     
            Despite their efforts, the system is still moving forward with its plan, frustrating Pontious, who moved to Elk County to be closer to family as he and his wife plan to start their own.
     
            âMy wife and I moved here, and she never thought that this was a concern that we would have to have: that weâd have to be fighting for womenâs services to be left in â not even our town â in our county,â he said.Â 
     
            In neighboring Cameron County, Commissioner Joshua Zucal said officials are also exploring options to offset the closure of Penn Highlands Elkâs labor and delivery unit, such as midwives to help with home births.
     
            âCameron County was never notified or brought into the loop that this was occurring. It was just something that we had to hear through the news of it happening,â he said.
     
            Zucal said itâs not just maternal health care that is taking a hit in rural Pennsylvania;Â some local doctorsâ and dental offices have also closed or relocated, and itâs hard for Cameron County to attract enough people to work for emergency response teams in the area.
     
            âThere are the basic needs communities must have, and we need to have access. Itâs not that we have lost all access, but you can see pieces of the puzzle falling apart,â he said.
     
            The county commissioner said he is focusing on the solutions to try to remain optimistic.
     
            âWhat are the things that we can implement to still have a thriving community, though there are challenges? How can we still focus on the quality of life that a rural community can offer? And then also the health and wellness aspects, that if youâre a healthy person, the amount of care that youâre going to need is much less than somebody whoâs unhealthy. So if we can create healthy communities, we wonât need such a crutch and be so reliant on these organizations that choose to do things such as closing maternity,â he said. âSo we just need to figure out solutions to take care of our own.â
     
            Many people think a birth, or birthing, center is the perfect solution for an area like Elk County. These centers â where people with low-risk pregnancies can deliver in aÂ home-like facility,Â with more autonomy over the experience â are designed to âprovide routine care and initiate emergency proceduresâ and must be positioned close enough to a hospital where women can get c-sections if they need, according to theÂ American Association of Birth Centers.
     
            âI think thatâs a really valuable resource that our community should look into,â Zuroski said. âItâs definitely a resource that I would consider using in the future.â
     
            Narbey, acknowledging her perspective as a midwife, also agrees.
     
            âThis is my biased opinion. I think midwives are part of the solution. Most women are low-risk, and we could staff a birthing center starting with three midwives, which is cheaper than an obstetrician, and midwives tend to be really good at connecting with their communities and meeting people in a culturally sensitive, appropriate trauma-informed perspective,â she said, adding that communities in Alaska, Montana and South Dakota are turning to this model as a solution.
     
            Health care wasnât at the front of Zuroskiâs mind when she moved to Elk County in her mid-20s. Now, the the environmental engineer said she feels a deep connection to the community.
     
            Itâs vibrant and green in the spring and summer and awash with fall color in the cooler months, and Zuroski says she was drawn to the area by the sky-scraping trees and the âbeautiful little mountain streams that hold wild trout populations.â
     
            âIâm willing to compromise and give up some things in order to stay here and live where Iâm happy,â she said.
     
            For now, Zuroski makes a 45-minute commute every four weeks to her appointments with a certified nurse midwife in Bradford, Pennsylvania, close to the New York state line.
     
            And when itâs time for the baby to come in August, she plans to pack up and head to Olean, New York, now one of the closest hospitals to her with a maternity ward.
     
            âTraveling far while in labor will be uncomfortable,â she said.
     
            McGahey says it is time for communities to step up to ensure that maternal health care remains accessible to families.
     
            âI think on a larger community level, we need to be advocating for us as a society to figure out how we value maternity care in our country because itâs not valued,â she said. âAs we can see, all of these maternity care deserts in our counties, across our state and the country, and this is leaving hundreds of thousands of families without care.
     
            âWhere you live and where you choose to raise your family shouldnât affect the quality of health care that you receive,â McGahey said. âAnd I think thatâs the biggest issue right now is how we continue to show families support and take good care of them.â
     
            Narbey agrees. âIn some cases, it can be a life-and-death situation, and that should never be the case. But unfortunately, your ZIP code determines more about your health outcomes than any other factor.â

            Ongoing testing of milk and dairy products by the US Food and Drug Administration has not found any active H5N1 bird flu virus in 297 samples of products purchased in grocery stores, the agency said Wednesday.
     
            The FDA has tested samples of fluid milk and other kinds of products made from milk, like cheese and sour cream, as well as products made with milk powder such as infant and toddler formula.
     
            In the first set of 96 samples, the agency said, 20% â 1 in 5 â contained remnants of the H5N1 virus, but additional tests to see whether the virus could actively infect eggs determined that those viral traces were inactive and would not be able to make people sick.
     
            Results from an additional 201 samples were released Wednesday and also showed no evidence of active virus.Â The agency didnât say where the sampled products were purchased.
     
            âThese additional preliminary results further affirm the safety of the US commercial milk supply,â said Dr. Don Prater, acting director of the FDAâs Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.
     
            The governmentÂ is also testing samples of raw and cooked ground beef purchased at grocery stores, as well as pooled raw milk sent to processors for pasteurization.
     
            The FDA said it continues to strongly advise against consuming raw milk and recommends that the industry does not manufacture or sell raw milk or raw milk products.
     
            The updates were part of a multiagency news conference on the governmentâs actions to evaluate and contain the H5N1 bird flu outbreak among dairy cows, which has spread to about three dozen herds in nine states: Texas, New Mexico, Michigan, Kansas, Idaho, Ohio, North Carolina, South Dakota and Colorado. The highest concentration of infected cattle is in Texas, where 12 herds have tested positive.
     
            The virus spreading in cows has not been shown to spread efficiently from person to person, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the public health risk is low.Â Only one person, a farm worker in Texas, has tested positive in connection to the outbreak.
     
            Dr. Rosemary Sifford, chief veterinary officer for the US Department of Agricultureâs Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said Wednesday that the agency believes the virus jumped from infected wild birds to cattle in the Texas Panhandle.
     
            âThe initial spillover event in that geographic region likely was not an individual herd but a number of herds in that region, and then animals from those herds moving to other herds in other states were the initial movements of the virus,â Sifford said.
     
            Cattle moving between states were probably asymptomatic, she said, and it may not have always been cows that were spreading the infection.
     
            âIn some cases, the movement of equipment or other items between herds, not necessarily cattle,â she said.
     
            Sifford said that USDA and CDC scientists have not seen any genetic changes to the sequences theyâve analyzed that would facilitate the spread of this type of flu in people.
     
            The CDC said certain people are at higher risk of infection than others, including those who work with poultry and livestock on farms, veterinarians and slaughterhouse workers.
     
            Members of these groups should avoid unprotected close contact with sick or dead birds or other animals, raw milk, udders of milk cows, feces or potentially contaminated water like buckets, pans, ponds or troughs.
     
            InÂ its updated recommendations, the CDC says workers should wear personal protective equipment including disposable coveralls or aprons, face masks, safety goggles or face shields, rubber boots, disposable hair covers and disposable gloves.
     
            If they are exposed to sick or potentially infected animals, the CDC advises workers to watch for symptoms for 10 days after the last known exposure.

            For her entire life, college student Olivia Cook had only a small degree of central vision. It was as if she was watching the world through a straw hole, and in dimly lit places, she could not make out peopleâs faces, only their silhouettes.
     
            But after receiving an experimental gene-editing treatment to one of her eyes, she now can see things she never saw before.
     
            Cook was born with an inherited retinal disorder that causes blindness, a rare type of eye disorder historically called Leber congenital amaurosis or LCA. A few years ago, she decided to participate in a clinical trial that involved using the gene-editing tool CRISPR to correct the form of inherited blindness that she has.
     
            âMy life has mostly changed in terms of being hopeful that there is going to be more science and findings in the future,â said Cook, 22, who is currently studying marketing and product development at Missouri State University in Springfield. She received the experimental gene-editing treatment through a surgery performed on her left eye.
     
            âNow, post-surgery and post recovery, I am able to see in dimmer lighting with my left eye,â Cook said.
     
            A treatment that used CRISPR was found to be safe and efficacious in improving vision among a small sample of patients with inherited blindness in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial that Cook participated in. Inherited retinal degenerations are a leading cause of blindness around the world.
     
            Among a total of 14 volunteers, including Cook, the gene-editing tool was found to be associated with a âmeaningful improvementâ in vision for most patients around three months later and it was not directly tied to any serious side effects, according to the trial results, published Monday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The therapy remains experimental and the results need to be replicated in a larger group of people.
     
            Months following the treatment, Cook was sitting with friends on a balcony that had Christmas lights wrapped around the railing. It was dusk, she recalled, yet she could see her friendsâ faces glow under the twinkling Christmas lights. She was shocked.
     
            âWith my right eye, I was not able to see their facial features. I was only able to see their silhouette. With my left eye, I could see everything on their face â so, significant difference, especially in the dim lighting,â Cook said about that evening.
     
            âOne of the biggest âaha momentsâ that I had was I had been talking to my mom one day after the surgery â it was about six to nine months after the surgery when I noticed most of my improvement,â Cook said.
     
            âI could see a candle flickering behind me, which Iâve never seen that before,â she said. âIâd never picked up anything from over there before with the peripheral.â
     
            Before the treatment, Cook said that she sometimes could conceal the vision challenges she has had.Â Her limited vision often was an internal struggle.
     
            âYou wouldnât really know that my eyesight is terrible until you spend a significant amount of time with me,â Cook said. âIf we saw each other in the street, if I introduced myself to you, youâd never know.â
     
            But now, she is no longer hiding.
     
            This study is the first time that CRISPR has been used in the eyes of living people.
     
            âThe results of this study provide proof of concept that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing can be used safely and effectively to treat inherited retinal disorders,â said the studyâs first author Dr. Eric Pierce, director of the Ocular Genomics Institute at Mass Eye and Ear and Harvard Medical School.
     
            The trial was funded by the biotechnology company Editas Medicine and conducted in the United States by researchers at Mass Eye and Ear of the Mass General Brigham health care system and other US-based institutions, including the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Michigan, the University of Miami, and Oregon Health & Science University.
     
            âWeâre really hopeful that CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technologies will now be applied to other genetic forms of inherited blindness, and indeed other genetic diseases in general,â Pierce said. âWeâre hoping this will help open the era of therapeutic use of CRISPR-Cas9 technologies.â
     
            The trial, which started in 2019, enrolled 12 adults, ages 17 to 63, and two children, ages 9 and 14, with inherited retinal degeneration caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene. That gene provides instructions for making a protein involved in many types of cells, including light receptor cells in the eyes. Mutations in CEP290 are the most common cause of severe early-onset retinal degeneration, which causes vision loss in children.
     
            Currently, there is no treatment approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CEP290-associated inherited retinal degeneration. These patients would not be able to read any lines of letters or numbers on a vision chart that most people receive at the eye doctor, and visual impairment may worsen over time.
     
            For the trial, the 14 participants underwent a surgical procedure in which a drug called EDIT-101 that encodes the CRISPR gene-editing components was injected under the retina of one of their eyes. Since the trial was conducted to primarily evaluate safety and efficacy, only one eye in each patient was studied.
     
            âThe subjects get an injection of the gene-editing drug, which is called EDIT-101, under their retina,â Pierce said. âThat drug encodes the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing machinery, and once that starts working inside the retinal cells of those patients, it cuts out the mutation in CEP290 from the genome of their retinal cells, allowing the function of the CEP290 gene to be restored.â
     
            When the first patients in the study were treated in 2020, it was the first time in medical history that a CRISPR-based medicine, resulting in gene-editing, was inserted directly into the living human body.
     
            Among the adult volunteers, two were given a low dose of the medication, five were given an intermediate dose and five were given a high dose. Both of the children in the study were given the intermediate dose. The outpatient procedure took around an hour and a half.
     
            The patients were then monitored every three months for a year and then less frequent monitoring continued for two years. In these follow-up visits, they underwent a series of vision tests among other evaluations.
     
            The researchers found that 11 patients in the study had some type of improvement in their vision following the CRISPR therapy, and these improvements occurred about three months after the procedure and were sustained during subsequent visits.
     
            Also, no serious side effects occurred in response to the treatment at any of the dose sizes, according to the researchers, and the adverse events that did occur were mild or moderate. There were also no signs that the CRISPR gene-editing caused ripple-effect harm to the genomes of the patients.
     
            âThe primary goal of this first in-human study was to test the safety of using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in vivo. When we started the trials, the subjects who were treated were the first patients ever to have received CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing treatments in vivo,â Pierce said. âThere were no serious adverse events related to the treatment, or the surgery required to deliver the treatment and no dose-limiting toxicities.â
     
            Following the surgery, one patient experienced some bleeding in the eye, impairing their vision, but that has since resolved, according to the researchers.
     
            âOnce that hemorrhage cleared, the subjectâs vision returned to baseline,â Pierce said.
     
            Another patient experienced vision impairment associated with small mounds observed under their retina six months after the procedure. These types of hyperreflective mounds have been seen in other studies involving subretinal gene therapies, the researchers noted, and the cause of them is not clear.
     
            âItâs thought to be inflammation,â Pierce said about the mounds.
     
            The patient was treated with a course of steroid medicines, according to the study, and their recovery is ongoing.
     
            âAs the mounds resolved their vision also improved,â Pierce said. âI think this drug was as safe as possible in terms of design.â
     
            Complete vision has not been restored among the patients. Most in the trial could not read any line of an eye chart prior to the study, and only four of them experienced some improvements in this ability. But some patients reported, after receiving treatment, being able to see their cell phones light up, differentiate various foods on their dinner plates, identify the spinning Apple icon on a computer screen or even noticing vibrant sunsets.
     
            âI started to see what are described as bursts of color,â said Michael Kalberer, 46, who received the CRISPR treatment in his right eye and first noticed improvements in his vision about two to six months later. He started the study in 2020.
     
            âIt was a pretty cool moment to see strobe lights on the dance floor of my cousinâs wedding change color,â said Kalberer, who added that if he had not received the treatment, all he would have seen on the dance floor would have been shadows and flickering lights, and he would not have been able to identify the colors.
     
            Kalberer described the CRISPR treatment as âgroundbreaking,â but warned itâs not a cure.
     
            âItâs not a panacea,â said Kalberer, who still canât see standard text or photos on a screen. âMy disease is still here. Itâs not gone. Iâm not cured. â¦ But it definitely slowed the progression of it.â
     
            Pierce said that he hopes this approach to using CRISPR as a therapy for inherited blindness can be studied again in a larger and more diverse group of patients. All of the Phase 1/2 trial participants were non-Hispanic and White.
     
            In 2022, Editas Medicine announced that it paused further studying CRISPR gene editing as a therapeutic approach for CEP290-associated inherited blindness and instead of conducting further trials, has continued to follow-up with the patients who have been treated to date.
     
            The latest results from the Phase 1/2 trial support moving forward with a Phase 3 trial and then ultimately registering the therapy for possible FDA approval, Pierce said.
     
            âWe are working with Editas to identify an additional commercial partner for Phase 3 studies. Weâre actually hoping this publication will stimulate interest in the biotech and pharma communities about that,â Pierce said.
     
            More research over time could shed light on the long-term effects of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tools, which, now that they have been injected into patients, will be present in patients for the rest of their lives, Pierce said.
     
            âI think the real risk that weâre all concerned about with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing is: Could the gene editing machinery that weâve introduced into the retinal cells of these patients do something else, somewhere else in the genome, in addition to the therapeutic activities that it was designed for?â Pierce said.
     
            âCould a cut in the genome be made 10 years from now, that could have an adverse effect over time? I think the answer to that is yes, it could. But weâre hopeful that risk is very low,â Pierce said. âThatâs what we need additional follow-up for.â
     
            The results from the Phase 1/2 trial â and how patients experienced some improvements in vision â are a valuable reminder of how important quality of life can be for patients, said Art Caplan, aÂ professor of bioethicsÂ and founding head of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicineâs Department of Population Health.
     
            âUsually when weâre doing gene therapies or other innovative interventions, we associate them with saving lives. This experiment is a huge reminder that quality of life matters. This is about vision,â Caplan said. âNo oneâs dying. No oneâs saved. But restoration of vision is an important achievement, and itâs a reminder that quality of life has to be factored into what we decide to cover in terms of insurance, reimbursement and what we try to study.â
     
            He agreed with the researchers that more safety data over time would be helpful.
     
            âThey havenât really had these subjects that long with the intervention to guarantee long-term safety,â Caplan said. âFor these kinds of genetic interventions, you have to follow them over long periods of time â years â to make sure that other genes werenât impacted.â
     
            These new Phase 1/2 trial results provide a âbuilding blockâ for scientists to work off of in the future when developing gene therapies to treat eye disorders, said Dr. Vlad Diaconita, a retinal surgeon and assistant professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. He was not involved in the trial.
     
            âDoes this apply to the American population at large? Not right now,â Diaconita said about the experimental treatment.
     
            âIt does, however, apply to the thousands of kids born in future years that have this particular genetic subtype. So yes, an approval of this particular gene delivery could benefit people over time,â he said. âItâs a proof of concept that seems to be moving us in the right direction.â
     
            Diaconitaâs colleague Dr. Aliaa Abdelhakim called this proof-of-concept study âgroundbreakingâ in the sense that it shows the treatment approach can be safe and result in some improvement for patients, but more research is neededÂ on a larger scaleÂ to determineÂ what kind of patients will benefit in the long term, and how long those improvements may last.
     
            âWe still have to wait a little longer to see if this pans out in the long-term,â said Abdelhakim, an ophthalmologist-geneticist, retina specialist and assistant professor of ophthalmology at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. She also was not involved in the trial.
     
            âWe donât know ifÂ improvements from this treatmentÂ are going to be sustained. Is their vision going toÂ stay improvedÂ throughout their lives?â she asked. âThe reason this is important is because this is the first time CRISPR has been used in this way, in the eye.â

            Deaths from drug overdoses and firearm-related injuries have reached record levels in the United States in recent years, and itâs created a âdouble burdenâ for children who face an increased risk of losing their parents and of dying themselves, according to the authors of a new study.
     
            Overall, more than 1 million children have lost a parent to a fatal drug overdose or gun violence over the past two decades, according to the study, published Saturday in the medical journal JAMA â and the burden has increased significantly over time.
     
            Nearly 100,000 children lost parents to a drug overdose or gun violence in 2020 alone â almost three times more than in 1999, the study found. These two causes of death accounted for 23% of all parental loss in 2020, nearly double the share from 1999.
     
            Direct data on the number of children who lost a parent to death from drugs or firearms is not available, so for this study, the researchers analyzed federal mortality data, fertility data and population demographics to estimate the scale of parental death from drugs or firearms.
     
            They found that the average age of people who died from a drug overdose or from a firearm-related injury in the US is about 42, an age at which people are likely to have young or teenage children.
     
            Federal data shows that drug overdose deaths are most common and rising fastest among people in their mid-30s and 40s, and the new study found a significant surge in parental losses from drug overdoses. About 72,800 children lost a parent to a drug overdose in 2020, up 345% from the 16,000 children affected in 1999, according to the study.
     
            There was a 39% increase in children who lost a parent to gun violence â from 18,000 in 1999 to 25,000 in 2020 â compared with a 24% increase in the number of children who lost parents to all other causes of death.
     
            Other research has shown that losing a parent can have negative effects on a childâs health, education and livelihood â in both the short and long term. And losing a parent to drugs or guns can be especially hard, said Robin Gurwitch, a psychologist and professor at the Duke University School of Medicine.
     
            Itâs more socially acceptable to talk about some causes of death such as cancer, she said. Deaths involving guns or drugs are not only traumatic deaths, theyâre often âsaid in whispers.â
     
            âWhen it canât be talked about openly and freely, it makes it harder for children to get the support they need,â said Gurwitch, who was not involved in the new study. âFor children who hold those things inside, the risk of it leaking out into everything from severe behavior challenges to bereavement disorders to other types of mental health challenges â anxiety, depression or their own substance abuse â goes way up.â
     
            Children are about three times more likely to lose a father to a drug overdose or firearm violence than they are to lose a mother, according to the new study â broadly in line with broader mortality trends for these two causes of death.
     
            And Black youth are disproportionately affected, largely because of a disproportionate rate of firearm deaths among Black fathers.
     
            In 2020, about 1 in every 1,000 Black children lost a parent to gun violence, compared with 1 in every 3,000 overall, according to the new study.
     
            These âsubstantialâ disparities in the burden of experiencing the death of a parent result in âdisadvantages in health over the life course and contributing to cumulative racial disadvantage,â the study authors wrote. âEfforts to stem this problem should prioritize averting drug overdoses and firearm violence, especially among structurally marginalized groups.â

            An outbreak of tuberculosis has led to a public healthÂ emergency in Long Beach, California.
     
            City Health Officer Dr. Anissa Davis declared a public healthÂ emergencyÂ ThursdayÂ in response to the outbreak,Â according to a city announcement, and the declaration is expected to be considered for ratification by the Long Beach City Council on Tuesday.
     
            In its investigation ofÂ the outbreak, the city health department has identified about 170 people who haveÂ probablyÂ been exposed to tuberculosis.Â But overall, âthe risk of TB for people who live, work, study or visit in Long Beach remains very low,â the announcement said.
     
            Tuberculosis, or TB, was found among several people associated with a single room occupancy hotel in Long Beach, according to the announcement. As of Monday, 14 cases were associated with the outbreak. and nine of them had been hospitalized at some point in their illness. One person has died.
     
            The city said that the name of the hotel will not be released to protect patient privacy and comply with regulations, but people who were staying at the hotel or who may otherwiseÂ have been exposed will be contacted by the health department.
     
            âThe outbreak is currently isolated to a distinct population and the risk to the general public is low. The population at risk in this outbreak has significant barriers to care including homelessness and housing insecurity, mental illness, substance use and serious medical comorbidities,â the announcement said.
     
            Health department staff are in the process of screening contacts for TB based on symptoms, blood or skin tests and chestÂ X-rays, according to the announcement.
     
            âScreening and treating such a large number of people requires many resources,â the announcement said. âDeclaring a public health emergency streamlines the Departmentâs ability to quickly secure resources and take additional action to contain the outbreak.â
     
            Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection, usually in the lungs, that can cause coughing, chest pain and fever â but itâs characterized by coughing up blood or mucus. Tuberculosis disease is curable, often treated with aÂ standardized courseÂ of drugs that usually includes antibacterial medicines. It can also be prevented with protocols such as screening,Â vaccinationÂ and making sure people who are infected finish their course of treatment.
     
            Last year, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned thatÂ tuberculosis cases reported across the United States appear to be returning to levels seen before the Covid-19 pandemic.
     
            The US incidence of tuberculosis increased slightly in 2022 after a 20.2% decline in 2020 and a 9.8% increase in 2021, according to the data publishedÂ in the CDCâs Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.
     
            Before the pandemic, the incidence of reported tuberculosis had fallen gradually in the United States from 1993 through 2019, falling to 2.7 cases per 100,000 people in 2019 and then to 2.2 in 2020, CDC data showed. Many tuberculosis cases may have been missed, misdiagnosed or delayed during the pandemic, the researchers said.

            Bird flu was probably circulating in dairy cows for at least four months before it was confirmed to be the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus, according to a new analysis of genomic data by scientists at the US Department of Agricultureâs Animal Disease Center.
     
            The research also found infected cattle that had no apparent connections, suggesting that âthere are affected herds that have not yet been identified,â the study said.
     
            It adds to a growing pile of evidence suggesting that the H5N1 virus had a head start in the US dairy industry for months before it came to the attention of scientists and government regulators.
     
            The USDAâs study wasÂ published as a preprint, ahead of peer review, on the BioRXIV server on Wednesday.
     
            It follows a similar analysis by an independent international group of almost two dozen evolutionary and molecular biologists who quickly analyzed raw genome sequences uploaded by the government to a server maintained by the National Library of Medicine.Â Despite the lack of critical background information on those samples, that group came to nearly the same conclusion as the USDA: that the virus had crossed over from wild birds to cows between mid-November and mid-January, which means it was circulating for months before anyone knew.
     
            The USDA officially confirmed the presence of the H5N1 virus on March 25 in dairy cows in Texas. Since then, at least three dozen infected herds have been reported across nine states.Â At least one farmworker who was in contact with infected cows in Texas also tested positive for H5N1, the second human case of this type of flu ever reported in the US. The worker was given antiviral medication and has recovered.
     
            Tests of milk from retail stores have shown inert remants of the virus in about 1 in 5 samples, the US Food and Drug Administration reported last week, suggesting that the infection had become widespread.Â Further testing by the FDA has confirmed that the virus in the samples of pasteurized dairy products was not active and couldnât make anyone sick, but experts have strongly advised against the consumption of raw milk.
     
            âWe could have done a much better jobâ catching H5N1 in dairy cows, said Dr. Michael Worobey, head of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Arizona who was part of the group of biologists that conducted the independent analysis. He studies how pandemics start.
     
            Worobey said that as soon as the cows were noticeably sick with something mysterious, instead of testing for specific viruses and bacteria, ideally, a lab would have used a technique called metagenomic sequencing, which reads all the genetic material in a sample and uses computers help pick out relevant information.
     
            âIf that had been done, that would have revealed H5N1 in January and then even beyond that,â he said.
     
            If weâre serious about preventing outbreaks in animals that could lead to human pandemics, Worobey said, regulators need to change their approach.
     
            âWe have to get out of the mindset of waiting for that tip of the iceberg of sick animals or sick humans to be noticed.â Instead, he said, animals need to be routinely tested with âmodern techniquesâ for identifiying emerging pathogens.
     
            The new study gives the USDAâs account of how bird flu seemed to spread so quickly to herds across the US.Â Samples collected between March 7 and April 8 found very similar H5N1 viruses in 26 herds in eight states and six poultry flocks in three states, suggesting that the virus had crossed over in a single spillover event between wild birds and cows.
     
            The study says âproduction veterinariansâ first noticed cows who werenât eating well with changes to their milk production and quality in late January.
     
            H5N1 has been devastating wild and domestic bird populations in the US since 2022, and it has infected a growing number of mammals.
     
            In addition to the movement between cattle and wild birds, the study found evidence that infected cattle had passed the virus to domestic poultry flocks âthrough multiple transmission routes.âÂ The researchers also found that the virus involved in the current outbreak had infected a wild animal â a raccoon â and cats that lived near the cows on dairy farms.
     
            Interestingly, the virus sequenced from the infected farmworker had key differences from the cow genomes.Â The USDA scientists concluded that the differences might mean they were missing samples from the animals the farmworker had come into contact with or could have been due to the evolution of the virus from host to host.
     
            Worobey says the study means H5N1 is ânow seemingly well-entrenched in the dairy cattle population in the countryâ and might be something we have to deal with for years to come.
     
            Although itâs by no means clear that this virus will change in the right combination of ways to launch a human pandemic, he said, allowing a virus to get a foothold in a population of domesticated animals puts everyone at risk.
     
            âIt does add one more species â a very important species â that didnât have influenza A virus circulating in it before to the list of species where these viruses can have the opportunity to find that right combination that allows them to wreak havoc in the human population, not just animals,â he said.

            It is crystal clear to many people that we are living in a time of climate crisisÂ caused in large part by the burning of fossil fuelsÂ , which lead to the emission of greenhouse gasses that trap the sunâs heat, raising temperatures and leading to a cascade of unintended and unwanted consequences.
     
            The climate crisis impacts Earth â its land, its atmosphere and its bodies of water â and it also profoundly affects the health and behavior of the planetâs inhabitants large and small, including humanity. And CNN Chief Climate Correspondent Bill Weir has a front-row seat to the ever-evolving situation.
     
            When Weir became a new âoldâ dad at the start of the pandemic â his son, River,Â was born in April 2020 (his daughter Olivia was 16 at the time) â he had a revelation.
     
            âI looked down at this little squiggling bundle of joy in my arms and realized this kid is going to live to see the 22nd century,â Weir told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently, on a special episode of the Chasing Life podcast. âAnd I started writing, sort of, a letter of apology to him for the planet we broke that he was moving into.â
     
            That letter eventually became the introduction of Weirâs new book, âLife As We Know It (Can Be): Stories of People, Climate, and Hope in a Changing World,â which came out earlier in April, in time for Earth Day.
     
            Weir said that everything in our lives depends on a planet in balance â and currently, itâs not.
     
            âFive million people die prematurely every year just to, just from particulate pollution of burning fossil fuels around the world,â Weir said. âThe heat already kills more people, I think, than all the other disasters combined.â
     
            Throughout all of this turmoil, people are all still trying to fulfill their needs, Weir said, pointing to Abraham Maslowâs hierarchy of needs.
     
            âLayer one is just the stuff that keeps you alive: air, water, temperature around 68 degrees Fahrenheit, (the) right amount of minerals, sleep. If you donât get those, nothing else matters,â he said.
     
            Weir said something clicked for him when he thought about the world his son was inheriting. âWhat if you can no longer take for granted the bottom of our pyramids, like I did? I never thought about where my waterÂ came from or the quality of my air,â he said.
     
            âThe Earth I joined in 1967 is gone now, and no one knows what kind of planet will replace it,â Weir wrote to River.
     
            The planetâs degradation has created climate grief â the mourning of a place we still live in, precisely because it is changing so dramatically under our very feet.
     
            Weir draws a parallel between these sentiments and another well-known model: the five stages of grief created by Elisabeth KÃ¼bler-Ross: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.
     
            âYou can take a road trip through America and drive through big swaths of denial,â Weir said. To essentially bargain with rising seas, he said, the city of Charleston, South Carolina, is erecting a seawall and Miami is raising streets. âThereâs a lot of anger, a lot of depression. But ultimately, until you get to acceptance, thatâs what turns people from survivors into thrivers or leads to a more peaceful end.â
     
            Weir said he hopes humanity can get to the acceptance phase quickly, and band together to address the issues facing us. He is optimistic â perhaps surprisingly, given the dire warnings we continue not to heed.
     
            What can you do to help the story end well for humanity? Weir has these five tips.
     
            Globally, we have got to get our fossil fuel consumption under control. The United States is among the top three greenhouse gas-emitting countries. When we burn fossil fuel for electricity, heat and transportation, the process generates these heat-trapping emissionsÂ Â .
     
            Weir recalls speaking to a fisherman in Maine, who called our addiction to carbon-based fossil fuels a âGodzilla.â
     
            âChopping up âCarbon Godzillaâ and putting him back where it came from is humanityâs No. 1 job going forward.â
     
            âThere are technological ways to do this, various nature-based ways to do it,â said Weir, noting that until that happens at scale, âitâs going to be hard to save this patient.â
     
            Take a page from the camel playbook. Camels are originally from Canada but adapted to the heat when they found themselves in the desert, Weir explained.
     
            âTwenty-five thousand years ago, the camels were dodging bears and jumping over beaver dams. And that big hump of fat was evolved to give them energy over the winter, and their eyelids were evolved to keep out snowstorms, not sandstorms,â Weir said. âAfter a couple of camels got lost and wandered across the Bering land bridge into Asia, (they) discovered that all these tools work great in sand and on long hot desert treks.â
     
            Humans donât have time on our side, said Weir, referring to the thousands of years it took camels to evolve, âbut we have the technology.â As an example, he cited the whitest paint ever created, which reflects 98% of light back into space and can cool a building by up to 19 degrees Fahrenheit Â (10.6 degrees CelsiusÂ ).
     
            Identify the people making positive changes and support them.
     
            Weir said the best tip he ever got for covering a disaster was from Mr. Rogers, who said his own mother told him to âlook for the helpersâ when he saw a scary event on TV.
     
            âThereâs always helpers rushing into disasters,â Weir said. When heâs really down, âI need to look for the helpers â not just people who are managing communities in the aftermath of something like the wildfire in Lahaina, or after a hurricane, but also the folks who are looking for better ideas and ways to fix the problem and to create healthier, more sustainable, resilient pieces of our lives.â
     
            Become an active member of your community; treat the environment and one another with the same respect and care that many Â indigenous communities do.
     
            âIt is taking care of water and soil and airâ¦ (that) fills those (Maslow) needs in ways that we canât imagine in our modern, convenient world,â he said. âWe live in the golden age of self-isolation, whereas we need each other more than ever,â he said.
     
            To do that, help in the way best suited to you, whether itâs organizing a rally, putting your expertise to work for a good cause or helping to clean up a neighborhood park.
     
            âI just want folks to connect with each other and nature in the best possibleÂ ways,â he said.
     
            When you have the opportunity, give the environment a break. Think about filling your basic Maslow-pyramid needs in a way that is more sustainable.
     
            In his book, Weir reminds us that Maslow wrote, âMan is a perpetually wanting animal.â But, Weir wrote, âhe (Maslow) leaves off âon a planet with finite resources.ââ
     
            â(It) doesnât matter how you draw the Pyramid of Needs; what matters is how you fill it,â Weir wrote.
     
            So consider how ï»¿you fill it. Maybe reduce your dependence on single-use plastics; walk to the market instead of driving; take into consideration the carbon footprint of your diet; take care not to waste food, water, materials, clothing. Small things add up.
     
            Listen to the full episodeÂ hereÂ . And join us next week on CNNâsÂ Chasing Life podcastÂ when we break down what you need to know about the bird flu virus and explain why itâs appearing in US dairy cows and what it means for milk drinkers.

            Drugmaker Novo Nordisk said itâs been increasing supply of its sought-after weight-loss drug Wegovy, with at leastÂ 25,000Â people now starting to take the medicine each week in the United States.
     
            Thatâs more than a capacity crowdÂ at Madison Square Garden, which holdsÂ 19,500 people.
     
            Itâs about five times more than were able to start the medicine each week in December, the Danish pharmaceutical giantÂ said in an earnings call Thursday.
     
            âThereÂ isÂ aÂ very,Â veryÂ significantÂ demand,â Novo Nordisk Chief Executive Officer Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told CNN Thursday in an interview. âSo for the foreseeable future, we believe the demand will outgrow supply. But we are gradually releasing more and more doses to the market.â
     
            The company, which also makes Ozempic for type 2 diabetes, has beenÂ limitingÂ how much of the lowest doses of Wegovy it has made available for the past year to avoid having too many new patients start the medicines amid a shortage. The drugs are designed to be started at lower doses that gradually increase over time in order to limit side effects like nausea.
     
            BothÂ Novo NordiskÂ andÂ Eli Lilly, which makes competitor drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound, have been working to combat shortages of the medicines amid unprecedented demand. The companies have been both buying andÂ buildingÂ manufacturing plants toÂ try to keep up, but the shortages â as well as difficult insurance coverage for many patients â can make the medicinesÂ hard to access.
     
            Jorgensen said Novo Nordisk has one plant in the US and one in Denmark that make the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, called semaglutide, and that theyâre building two more in Denmark.
     
            The company has also expanded capacity at existing plants that do âfill-finish,â the next steps in the manufacturing process to put the drugs in vials or pens, he said, and acquired three additional sites with a $16.5 billion purchase of drug manufacturing company Catalent.
     
            âWe have a massive expansion program,â Jorgensen said. âSo weâll have gradual new capacities coming in line over the coming months and years to keep that journey going and reach many more patients than we serve today.â
     
            Jorgensen called the investments in manufacturing âprobably the biggest [capital expenditures] program in the history of pharmaceutical expansion,â comparing the scale of increase to the race to make enough Covid-19 vaccines during the pandemic.
     
            âDuring the pandemic we had to scale up manufacturing capacity for vaccines, but that was, say, two, three, four doses per person,â Jorgensen said. âHere, weâre talking about weekly injections. Weâre talking about, [for] many patients, chronic treatment.â
     
            EliÂ Lilly, Novo Nordiskâs biggest competitor,Â also said this week it expects supply to increase later this year.
     
            âThe demand for tirzepatide is very strong,âÂ LillyÂ Chief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi said on the companyâs quarterly earnings conference call, referring to the active ingredient in Mounjaro and Zepbound.
     
            âEach week, hundreds of thousands of people fill [prescriptions] for Mounjaro and Zepbound, yet we understand the frustration from those facing prescription delays or uncertainties getting their medicine,â Ashkenazi continued. âWhile we are working tirelessly to ramp supply and expect meaningful increases in shipment volumes in the second half of the year, demand continues to outstrip even increased supply.â
     
            Prescription data shows that Novo Nordiskâs Ozempic is the most widely prescribed drug of the four major ones in the class, known as GLP-1 receptor agonists after the gut hormone they emulate. Lillyâs medicines also mimic a second hormone, called GIP. They all work by reducing appetite, regulating insulin and slowing digestion of food to make people feel full for longer.
     
            There are more than 500,000 total prescriptions for Ozempic each week in the US, according to data cited by financial firm BMO Capital Markets. Lillyâs Mounjaro is the second-most prescribed medicine in the group, with around 300,000 weekly prescriptions. Both of those medicines are approved for type 2 diabetes, but doctors also prescribe them off-label for weight loss.
     
            Ozempic was the first of the four to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, in December 2017. Wegovy was approved in June 2021, Mounjaro in May 2022 and Zepbound in November 2023.
     
            Ultimately, the drugs are expected to be much more widely used for weight loss than type 2 diabetes, given how many patients fall into each category. BMO analyst Evan Seigerman, who follows the stocks of both Lilly and Novo Nordisk, said he estimates GLP-1 drugs globally will bring in $74 billion in diabetes in 2030, and $104 billion by then in obesity.
     
            Insurance coverage has been more difficult for drugs approved primarily for weight loss, although both Novo Nordisk and Lilly said this week that was improving in the US.
     
            About 50 million Americans currently have insurance coverage for Wegovy, Jorgensen said, and Lilly told investors this week that about 67% of Americans with commercial insurance have coverage for Zepbound. Jorgensen also said Medicaid coverage is improving, noting âa number of states have opted in and see that thereâs value in treating patients living with obesity.â
     
            Wegovy wasÂ shownÂ in a major clinical trial last year to not only aid with weight loss, but also to prevent heart attacks, strokes and heart-related death in people at elevated cardiovascular risk, potentially increasing demand for the medicine even further, but also improving insurance coverage; the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services subsequently said Medicare plans could cover the medicine for heart benefits.
     
            âWe are only getting to, say, a million Americans so far out of the 50 millionâ whose insurance would cover Wegovy, Jorgensen said. He noted a million is the number of patients who have ever been prescribed Wegovy in the US, and fewer are currently taking the medicine, though he didnât specify precisely how many. More than 40% of US adults are estimated to have obesity, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or about 100 million people.
     
            âSo I think availability of medicines is probably a bigger challenge than, actually, accessâ through insurance coverage, Jorgensen said.

            The rumors are true: Vegetables arenât real â that is, in botany, anyway.
     
            While the termÂ fruitÂ is recognized botanically as anything that contains a seed or seeds, vegetable is actually a broad umbrella term for many types of edible plants.
     
            You might think you know what carrots and beets are. Carrots, beets and other vegetables that grow in the ground are actually the true roots of plants. Lettuce and spinach are the leaves, while celery and asparagus are the stems, and greens such as broccoli, artichokes and cauliflowers are immature flowers, according toÂ Steve Reiners, a professor of horticulture at Cornell Universityâs College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.
     
            As for produce that grow from flowers, such as peppers and tomatoes, the hot-debated crops are botanically classified as fruits, Reiners added. Cucumbers, squash, eggplant and avocados are also classified as fruit due to their anatomy, according to theÂ European Food Information Council.
     
            The term vegetable does not have a set definition when it comes to botany. However, inÂ horticulture, the science of growing garden crops, a vegetable is defined as any herbaceous plant â a fleshy plant that completes its life cycle in a growing season â in which some portion âis eaten either cooked or raw, during the principal part of the meal, and not as like a snack or dessert,â Reiners said.
     
            The legal definitionÂ of a vegetable versus a fruit â at least in the United States â was determined during aÂ 19th century US Supreme CourtÂ case that concluded that the tomato is a vegetable.
     
            While vegetables are really just the roots, stems and leaves of plants, experts donât recommend eating just any roots, stems and leaves.
     
            One example is rhubarb. The fleshy stalk is the edible part of the plant, but the leaves are poisonous, Reiners said. Stay safe by eating plants that grocery stores commonly call vegetables.Â 
     
            âWe know (vegetables) are healthy. We know the vitamin content, we know the mineral content,â Reiners said. âWe know how much fiber is in all of it.
     
            âWe also know that the vegetables that you either grow or youâre purchasing at a farmers market or grocery store are safe to eat,â he said.
     
            By understanding the various parts of vegetables and the nutrients they carry, people can eat well, according toÂ Sherri Stastny, a registered dietitian and a professor in the department of health, nutrition and exercises sciences at North Dakota State University.
     
            A head of broccoli is a great source of nutrients, but the stem of the green, which is more commonly thrown out, is also rich in fiber and nutrients, Stastny said. The regular consumption of flowery produce such asÂ broccoli and cauliflowerÂ have been found to be associated with a decrease in the risk of cancer, she added.
     
            âHeart diseaseÂ is still the No. 1 killerÂ in the United States, and we know that if you eat enough fruits and vegetables, you lower your risk for heart disease â and that goes along with obesity, diabetes and all these other chronic diseases,â Stastny said.
     
            It is important to eat a variety of vegetables since each one will have varying beneficial nutrients, she added. Dark leafy greens such as spinach and kale are great sources of certain phytonutrients, natural nutrients from plants that are beneficial to human health, that help to maintain sharp eye vision, while carrots will help to strengthen night vision.
     
            âIf you think of the richest, darkest, most colorful vegetables, thatâs where youâre going to find those (nutrients),â Stastny said, while potassium-rich vegetables and fruit, such as potatoes, pumpkin and squash, could help to lower and maintain blood pressure.
     
            For parents looking to get young kids to eat their fruits and veggies, breaking down the anatomy of the plant, while describing the colors, taste and texture, could be a fun and educational way of introducing the nutrient-dense foods to the early explorers.
     
            âStart them young,â Stastny said. âIf you introduce children to vegetables at a younger age â¦ theyâre more likely to eat vegetables throughout their lifespan and therefore decrease the risk of chronic disease.â

            Walking has earned a reputation as a great form of exercise thatâs easy and accessible for many people, and scores of studies show the popular activity has numerous health benefits, too.
     
            Getting at least 2,300 steps per day reduces your risk of dying from cardiovascular disease, according to one study published in a 2023 edition of the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.
     
            In addition, weight-bearing exercises such as walking help prevent osteoporosis, according to another study published in the journal Nature Scientific Reports.
     
            Yet some experts in the health and fitness fields assert that while walking is certainly good for your health and fitness, itâs not really high-quality exercise. One such expert is Melissa Boyd, a certified personal trainer and coach with Tempo, an online personal training platform. Boyd is based in San Francisco.
     
            âOur lives have gotten so busy â we commute, sit all day, then are exhausted at night â that getting a short walk in makes you feel like youâve done this big, exponential thing,â Boyd said. âBut walking is really a baseline movement your body requires to function well, to help with things like circulation and digestion, and to decompress.â
     
            To help her clients better understand why a daily walk wonât result in a beach body â something many of them believe, thanks to various social media influencers â she discusses with them the three types of movement that are beneficial for overall health and fitness.
     
            First is the movement your body is owed or requires every day, such as walking, stretching and bending. Second is athletic movement, which you can do a few times a week to improve your fitness or to train for a sport. Third is social movement that you do for fun or to connect with others, such as dancing or playing volleyball.
     
            âItâs important to think of movement in these different categories because not moving throughout the day has become normalized,â Boyd said. âOur lives are so sedentary, many of us are trying to dig ourselves out of a movement deficit. But exercise is different from physical movement.â
     
            Walking is great, but itâs just one, unidirectional form of movement, and our bodies need more to be functionally fit, said Dr. Carl Cirino, a sports medicine surgeon at HSS Orthopedics with Stamford Health in Connecticut.
     
            People use the muscles and tendons in their bodies to assist with all the bending, twisting and rotating they do in their daily lives, Cirino said, so they need to work and stretch them in many different directions. Yoga and Pilates are two activities that are very effective and healthy in this regard, he said.
     
            âStretching is also incredibly easy, and something you can do when you wake up and before you go to bed,â Cirino said.
     
            Having loose, pliable muscles also means you will have more balance and stability, which helps prevent falls and injuries in all physical activities, he said. Itâs also good to get your heart rate up several times a week for cardiovascular health.
     
            Ideally, you should create a plan that incorporates daily âowedâ movements, such as walking and stretching, with some cardiovascular work, strength training and social activity sprinkled throughout the week, the two said. That can seem overwhelming for many, however.
     
            Breaking down all these different movements into exercise snacks is one way to sneak in the movement your body needs, Boyd said.
     
            âMaybe get a walking pad and do some of your meetings while walking slowly on the pad,â she said. âMaybe every time you go to the bathroom, you do 20 squats, or every time you get water, you do 10 push-ups against a wall. If you attach these exercise snacks to something else youâre already doing, you can make it more of a habit. Iâve seen huge success with this.â
     
            Boyd also encourages her clients to find some form of movement they enjoy that doesnât seem like a workout, such as playing kickball or pickleball. That way, youâre having fun and being social while getting fitter.
     
            Cirino agrees. âWe see kids here in sports medicine whose parents want them to play baseball, but they donât want to do it,â he said. âItâs the same with exercise. You need to find something thatâs interesting and easy â maybe an activity your friends are doing â and use that as the basis to build good habits.â
     
            Rethinking exercise as regular movements your body needs for functionality, fitness and social connection also can be a means of giving yourself permission to carve out time for working out, Boyd said.
     
            Itâs also helpful to keep in mind that creating an exercise plan doesnât require an immediate, massive change in your lifestyle. In fact, itâs better to start slowly with new, little chunks of movement.
     
            âWhat I usually see is that people love the way this starts to make them feel,â Boyd said. âThen the stronger they become, the more they want to move even more. Movement inspires movement.â

            May kicks off with the Eta Aquariid meteor shower, and experts are anticipating a better show than in recent years, according to the American Meteor Society.
     
            During the period when the meteor shower is expected to peak â in the early morning hours of Sunday and Monday, according to EarthSky â the moon, in its new moon phase, will only be 6% illuminated. Experts suggest keeping an eye on the sky between 2 and 5 a.m. local time.
     
            The Eta Aquariid shower is often considered the best meteor shower of the year for the Southern Hemisphere, where sky-watchers could see between 20 and 40 meteors each hour, or perhaps even more, according to EarthSky. In the Northern Hemisphere, observers can expect to see between 10 and 20 meteors in the hours before dawn, according to NASA.
     
            The source of the Eta Aquariid meteor shower is Halleyâs comet. Earth crosses the cometâs orbital path each spring between April and May, causing small grains of rock and dust shed by the comet to strike our planetâs atmosphere and create a dazzling meteor display. It happens again in October, resulting in the Orionid meteor shower.
     
            Halleyâs comet was last visible streaking across Earthâs night sky in 1986, and it will swing back by in 2061 as it travels on a 76-year orbit around the sun.
     
            The meteors appear to be coming from the northeastern part of the Aquarius constellation, which contributes to the name of the shower.
     
            The rate of visible meteors per hour this year is âexpected to be enhanced by debris perturbed by Jupiter in a direction closer to the Earth,â according to the American Meteor Society. âThis last occurred in 2013, when rates were significantly enhanced.â
     
            Astronomers anticipated higher rates from the Eta Aquariids in 2023, but a full moon outshone the meteors, and scientists couldnât verify whether the enhancement occurred. But with no lunar interference on the horizon, the rate of visible meteors could double if the enhancement happens, according to the American Meteor Society.

            An annular solar eclipse will occur in the sky on October 2 over parts of South America. This type of eclipse is similar to a total solar eclipse, except the moon is at the farthest point in its orbit from Earth, so it canât completely block the sun. Instead, annular solar eclipses create a âring of fireâ in the sky as the sunâs fiery light surrounds the moonâs shadow.
     
            A partial lunar eclipse, when Earth moves between the sun and the full moon without being perfectly aligned, will appear over Europe and much of Asia, Africa, North America and South America between September 17 and 18.

            May kicks off with the Eta Aquariid meteor shower, and experts are anticipating a better show than in recent years, according to the American Meteor Society.
     
            During the period when the meteor shower is expected to peak â in the early morning hours of Sunday and Monday, according to EarthSky â the moon, in its new moon phase, will only be 6% illuminated. Experts suggest keeping an eye on the sky between 2 and 5 a.m. local time.
     
            The Eta Aquariid shower is often considered the best meteor shower of the year for the Southern Hemisphere, where sky-watchers could see between 20 and 40 meteors each hour, or perhaps even more, according to EarthSky. In the Northern Hemisphere, observers can expect to see between 10 and 20 meteors in the hours before dawn, according to NASA.
     
            The source of the Eta Aquariid meteor shower is Halleyâs comet. Earth crosses the cometâs orbital path each spring between April and May, causing small grains of rock and dust shed by the comet to strike our planetâs atmosphere and create a dazzling meteor display. It happens again in October, resulting in the Orionid meteor shower.
     
            Halleyâs comet was last visible streaking across Earthâs night sky in 1986, and it will swing back by in 2061 as it travels on a 76-year orbit around the sun.
     
            The meteors appear to be coming from the northeastern part of the Aquarius constellation, which contributes to the name of the shower.
     
            The rate of visible meteors per hour this year is âexpected to be enhanced by debris perturbed by Jupiter in a direction closer to the Earth,â according to the American Meteor Society. âThis last occurred in 2013, when rates were significantly enhanced.â
     
            Astronomers anticipated higher rates from the Eta Aquariids in 2023, but a full moon outshone the meteors, and scientists couldnât verify whether the enhancement occurred. But with no lunar interference on the horizon, the rate of visible meteors could double if the enhancement happens, according to the American Meteor Society.

            Boeingâs spaceflight program may reach a significant milestone Monday night with the launch of its Starliner spacecraft, carrying â at long last â two NASA astronauts to orbit.
     
            The mission, dubbed the Crew Flight Test, could take off as soon as Monday at 10:34 p.m. ET from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.
     
            Live coverage of the event will stream on NASA channels beginning at 6:30 p.m. ET Monday, according to the space agency.
     
            The occasion is a decade in the making â the culmination of Boeingâs efforts to develop a spacecraft worthy of ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station under NASAâs Commercial Crew Program.
     
            Development hang-ups, test flight problems and other costly setbacks have slowed Starlinerâs path to the launchpad. Meanwhile, Boeingâs rival under NASAâs commercial crew programÂ â SpaceX â has become the go-to transportation provider for the space agencyâs astronauts.
     
            Now, NASA and Boeing have finally deemed the Starliner spacecraft ready for its ultimate test: allowing astronauts to test-drive the vehicle in outer space.
     
            Veteran NASA astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore will be on board Mondayâs mission, riding Starliner to the International Space Station for a weeklong stay.
     
            Throughout their flight, Wilmore and Williams will conduct a series of tests, including briefly taking over the controls of the autonomous spacecraft and evaluating how the vehicle operates for astronauts.
     
            A smooth flight could be a winning moment for Boeingâs spaceflight program and the company overall, which has been in the hotseat due to issues with its commercial airplane division.
     
            Hereâs what to know about Starlinerâs journey before its historic crewed test flight.
     
            Officials at Boeing have sought to make clear that Starliner operates separately from the sector at the company responsible for commercial aircraft. And the Starliner teamâs primary interest is in ensuring a smooth test mission and crew safety, according to Mark Nappi, vice president and Starliner program manager at Boeing.
     
            âWe have humans flying on this vehicle. We always takeÂ that so seriously,â Nappi said during a news briefing last week. âI spent my career in this business, and it always has been the top of the list.â
     
            The two Starliner astronauts have waited years for the spacecraft to be deemed ready to carry crew. After several astronauts rotated in and out of assignments on Starlinerâs Crew Flight Test, Wilmore received his appointment in 2020. NASA moved Williams onto this flight in 2022 after initially assigning her in 2018 to a later Starliner mission.
     
            âWeâve had a couple (of) launch dates, and weâve been like, âOK, weâre ready to go,ââ Williams said at a Wednesday news conference. âBut now itâs like, heck â five days. It is actually, finally real, and I sort of have to pinch myself a little bit to understand, actually, weâre going.â
     
            At a news briefing last month, Steve Stich, the program manager for NASAâs Commercial Crew Program, said that NASA required Boeing and SpaceX to meet a certain threshold regarding the risk the mission would result in the death of astronauts â 1 in 270.
     
            âBoeing exceeds that number with a 1 in 295 loss of crew number,â he said.
     
            Boeing received a NASA contract to build Starliner in 2014 at the same time the space agency selected SpaceX to build its Crew Dragon capsule.
     
            NASA gave the companies deals worth up to $6.8 billion combined, hoping that Boeing and SpaceX would both have their capsules ready to fly as soon as 2017.
     
            That expectation didnât pan out.
     
            SpaceX took longer than planned, flying the inaugural astronaut launch of its Crew Dragon capsule in the summer of 2020. It has since completed 13 missions to orbit for NASA astronauts and paying customers.
     
            But Boeing â despite NASA officials initially believing the Starliner would be ready before SpaceXâs Crew Dragon â faced years of additional delays, setbacks and added expenses that have cost the company more than $1 billion, according to public financial records.
     
            Notably, the first Starliner test mission, flown without crew in late 2019, was riddled with missteps. The vehicle misfired in orbit, a symptom of software problems that included a coding error that set an internal clockÂ off by 11 hours.
     
            A second uncrewed flight test in 2022 uncovered additional software issues and trouble with some of the vehicleâs thrusters.
     
            Those hang-ups delayed the inaugural crewed flight into 2023. But then a new slate of problems arose â the spacecraftâs parachutes had some components that were weaker than expected, and tape in the vehicle was found to be flammable.
     
            Boeing then had to remove more than a mileâs worth of that tape and complete additional tests of the parachutes.
     
            Finally, after a decade of development, NASA and Boeing have cleared the vehicle to fly astronauts.
     
            Williams and Wilmore have taken a measured approach when responding to questions about the Starliner spacecraftâs development woes.
     
            âI understand it when you say âsetback,ââ Wilmore said during the recent news conference. âBut honestly, with all the discovery â thatâs what we would term it â that weâve had, itâs been steps forward.
     
            âItâs not been a setback, itâs been pressing forward,â he said. âAnd our families have lived that with us.â
     
            Williams added that she is prepared to go into Mondayâs mission with the expectation that small issues may arise.
     
            âWe always find stuff, and we are going to continually find stuff,â she said Wednesday. âEverythingâs not going to be absolutely perfect as we fly the spacecraft. And thatâs really what our goal is. Weâve got it to a point â all of us, big team â got it to a point that we feel very safe and comfortable with how this spacecraft flies, and we have backup procedures in case we need those.â
     
            âWeâre here,â Williams said, âbecause weâre ready.â

            Many species of animals form social groups and behave collectively: An elephant herd follows its matriarch, flocking birds fly in unison, humans gather at concert events. Even humble fruit flies organize themselves into regularly spaced clusters, researchers have found.
     
            Within those social networks, certain individuals will often stand out as âgatekeepers,â playing an important role for cohesion and communication within that group.
     
            And now, scientists believe there is evidence that how central you are to your social network, a concept they call âhigh betweenness centrality,â could have a genetic basis. New research published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications has identified a gene responsible for regulating the structure of social networks in fruit flies.
     
            The studyâs authors named the gene in question âdegrees of Kevin Bacon,â or dokb, after a game that requires players to link celebrities to actor Bacon in as few steps as possible via the movies they have in common.
     
            Inspired by âsix degrees of separation,â the theory that nobody is more than six relationships away from any other person in the world, the game became a viral phenomenon three decades ago.
     
            Senior author Joel Levine, a professor of biology at the University of Toronto who went to high school with Bacon in Philadelphia, said the actor was a good human example of âhigh betweenness centrality.â
     
            Aware of Levineâs link with Bacon, study lead author Rebecca Rooke, a postdoctoral fellow of biology at the University of Toronto Mississauga, suggested the geneâs name.
     
            âThe degrees of separation is a real-world thing for us,â Levine said.
     
            Having high measures of centrality in a group network can be positive or negative, Levine explained.
     
            âPatterns of sharing and communication can be absolutely wonderful,â he said. âYou also have patterns that contribute to the spread of lethal diseases and infectious diseases, but the structure of the group is the same structure. Itâs not a good or a bad or a positive or a negative.â
     
            Levine said that the âdegrees of Kevin Baconâ gene was specific to fruit fliesâ central nervous systems, but he thought similar genetic pathways would exist in other animals, including humans. The study opened up new opportunities for exploring the molecular evolution of social networks and collective behavior in other animals.
     
            The researchers investigated a number of gene candidates in fruit flies, a common lab organism used in the study of genetics.
     
            âWe found two versions of the dokb gene and one version produces networks with high betweenness centrality and the other version produces networks with low betweenness centrality,â Levine said.
     
            âA network with a high average betweenness centrality indicates there are individuals in the network important for the flow of information from one part of the network to other parts.â
     
            The team used gene-editing techniques to knock out and swap these distinct variants to see what happened among different strains of flies. This exchange influenced the patterns of interaction among a network of flies, with a social group taking on the pattern of the donor variant.
     
            âThe difference that we would see is a difference in group cohesion. Itâs not a difference that you would see with your naked eye,â Levine said.
     
            If you observe video footage of fruit flies in a dish in the lab, Levine said they appear to interact with one another, forming repeatable patterns specific to different strains that can be analyzed statistically.
     
            âWhat we know is that thereâs a repeatable structure to the groups that theyâre in,â Levine said. âAnd we imagine that those structures facilitate how they live.â
     
            In nature, fruit flies show group behavior when laying eggs and encountering predators, Levine said.
     
            âIn our paper, we donât actually characterize what is flowing through the network, so it is hard to speculate what advantages/disadvantages there are to flies who form these different patterns of interaction,â he explained in an email.
     
            âHowever, we do show that the two different dokb variants exist in several wild strains of flies spanning the globe and that one of these variants correlates with low elevation environments,â Levine said. âPerhaps in low elevations, certain patterns of interaction are advantageous? Again, we donât directly test this, so it is just speculation.â
     
            Allen J. Moore, a distinguished research professor at the University of Georgiaâs department of entomology, said in an email that the research was âcareful workâ and he agreed with the findings.
     
            âAlthough a first step â and we (and they) donât know exactly how it works â it is fascinating to find a single gene that influences social cohesion,â said Moore, who wasnât involved in the research but reviewed the paper before publication. 
     
            Drosophila melanogaster, best known for hovering around fruit bowls, has been a model organism to explore genetics for more than 100 years. The insects breed quickly and are easy to keep.
     
            While flies are very different from humans, the creatures have long been central to biological and genetic discovery.
     
            âFruit flies are useful because of the power of manipulation. We can investigate things experimentally in Drosophila that we can only examine indirectly in most organisms,â Moore said.
     
            The tiny creatures share nearly 60% of our genes, including those responsible for Alzheimerâs, Parkinsonâs, cancer and heart disease. Research involving fruit flies has previously shed light on the mechanisms of inheritance, circadian rhythms and mutation-causing X-rays.

            Many species of animals form social groups and behave collectively: An elephant herd follows its matriarch, flocking birds fly in unison, humans gather at concert events. Even humble fruit flies organize themselves into regularly spaced clusters, researchers have found.
     
            Within those social networks, certain individuals will often stand out as âgatekeepers,â playing an important role for cohesion and communication within that group.
     
            And now, scientists believe there is evidence that how central you are to your social network, a concept they call âhigh betweenness centrality,â could have a genetic basis. New research published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications has identified a gene responsible for regulating the structure of social networks in fruit flies.
     
            The studyâs authors named the gene in question âdegrees of Kevin Bacon,â or dokb, after a game that requires players to link celebrities to actor Bacon in as few steps as possible via the movies they have in common.
     
            Inspired by âsix degrees of separation,â the theory that nobody is more than six relationships away from any other person in the world, the game became a viral phenomenon three decades ago.
     
            Senior author Joel Levine, a professor of biology at the University of Toronto who went to high school with Bacon in Philadelphia, said the actor was a good human example of âhigh betweenness centrality.â
     
            Aware of Levineâs link with Bacon, study lead author Rebecca Rooke, a postdoctoral fellow of biology at the University of Toronto Mississauga, suggested the geneâs name.
     
            âThe degrees of separation is a real-world thing for us,â Levine said.
     
            Having high measures of centrality in a group network can be positive or negative, Levine explained.
     
            âPatterns of sharing and communication can be absolutely wonderful,â he said. âYou also have patterns that contribute to the spread of lethal diseases and infectious diseases, but the structure of the group is the same structure. Itâs not a good or a bad or a positive or a negative.â
     
            Levine said that the âdegrees of Kevin Baconâ gene was specific to fruit fliesâ central nervous systems, but he thought similar genetic pathways would exist in other animals, including humans. The study opened up new opportunities for exploring the molecular evolution of social networks and collective behavior in other animals.
     
            The researchers investigated a number of gene candidates in fruit flies, a common lab organism used in the study of genetics.
     
            âWe found two versions of the dokb gene and one version produces networks with high betweenness centrality and the other version produces networks with low betweenness centrality,â Levine said.
     
            âA network with a high average betweenness centrality indicates there are individuals in the network important for the flow of information from one part of the network to other parts.â

            Scientists working in Indonesia have observed an orangutan intentionally treating a wound on their face with a medicinal plant, the first time this behavior has been documented.
     
            Rakus, a male Sumatran orangutan, treated a wound on his face by chewing leaves from a climbing plant named Akar Kuning and repeatedly applying the juice to it, according to a paper published in the journal Scientific Reports on Thursday.
     
            Rakus then covered the wound with the chewed up leaves, which are used in traditional medicine to treat illnesses like dysentery, diabetes and malaria, said scientists.
     
            Study lead author Isabelle Laumer, a post-doctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, told CNN that the team were âvery excitedâ by their observations, which took place in June 2022 in the Suaq Balimbing research area in Gunung Leuser National Park, Indonesia.
     
            Although other wild primate species are known to swallow, chew or rub themselves with plants that have medicinal properties, scientists have never seen them used to treat recent wounds.
     
            The team believe that Rakus intentionally used the plant to treat his wound as he applied it repeatedly in a process that researchers say took several minutes.
     
            âThis possibly innovative behavior presents the first report of active wound management with a biological active plant in a great ape species,â she said.
     
            Researchers believe that Rakus most likely sustained the wound in a fight with another male orangutan, which are rare in the area thanks to âhigh food availability, high social tolerance between orangutans and relatively stable social hierarchies,â Laumer explained.
     
            This means that orangutans rarely suffer wounds, giving researchers few opportunities to observe this behavior.
     
            As for how Rakus would have learned how to treat a wound, one possibility is âaccidental individual innovation,â said Laumer.
     
            The orangutan may have touched his wound accidentally while feeding on the plant and felt immediate pain relief due to its analgesic â pain relieving â effects, making him repeat the behavior, she explained.
     
            Another possible explanation is that Rakus learned how to treat a wound from other orangutans in the area where he was born, said Laumer.
     
            The observation âprovides new insights into the existence of self-medication in our closest relatives and in the evolutionary origins of wound medication more broadly,â added Laumer, raising the possibility that wound treatment may originate in a common ancestor shared by humans and orangutans.
     
            Researchers plan to closely observe any other wounded orangutans in the area to see if the behavior is repeated, said Laumer, who added that the findings underline the commonalities between humans and orangutans.
     
            âWe are more similar than different,â she said. âWe hope this study raises awareness on their critically endangered status in the wild.â

            As reproductive health remains a key issue in the 2024 US presidential election, a recent executive order signed by President Joe Biden to improve womenâs health research grabbed headlines. The March 18 directive is notable for its aim to integrate womenâs health across federal agencies and drive new research. The timing could not be better.
     
            For centuries, medical researchers have exclusively studied men, downplaying or outright ignoring sex differences and extrapolating their findings to women. However, women are not physiologically the same as men â marked most plainly with the onset of menstruation at female puberty and two X chromosomes â and thus have often been given incomplete, poor and even harmful medical advice.
     
            This long-standing lack of female-based research stemming from sex and gender bias spurred Dr. Stacy Sims, an exercise physiologist and nutrition scientist based in Mount Maunganui, New Zealand, to devote her career to determining how women should be eating and exercising for optimal health. âIf we work with our physiology knowing that women are women and men are men, knowing that women are not small men, then imagine the (health) outcomes,â she said at a 2019 TED talk.
     
            READ MORE: Lab rats are overwhelmingly male, and thatâs a problem
     
            Cardiac arrest is a good example. While it was known in 2007 that women are nearly twice as likely to die from heart attacks as men, and that they report many more symptoms associated with acute coronary syndromes, a National Institutes of Health study published that year still recommended against differentiating heart attack symptoms between men and women.
     
            Even today, women remain broadly underrepresented in medical literature, according to a study published in 2022 in Womenâs Health Reports. Misogynistic attitudes remain as well. And while the US National Institutes of Health in 2016 implemented a policy requiring researchers to consider sex as a variable in their biomedical research, the results were mixed.
     
            The number of studies including women did noticeably increase after this policy debuted. However, a 2019 bibliometric analysis â a rigorous means of analyzing large volumes of data â showed the majority of more than 700 medical studies failed to analyze the resulting data by sex, limiting their usefulness.
     
            Sims, who is also author of the science-based book âRoar,â which details sex-based differences in exercise and nutrition at different life stages, recently shared her thoughts on the topic with CNN.
     
            Before beginning any new exercise program, consult your doctor. Stop immediately if you experience pain. This conversation was edited and condensed for clarity.
     
            CNN: How can it possibly be that women are still so medically understudied in 2024?
     
            Dr. Stacy Sims: I know! Isnât it crazy? Historically, when you think about who developed science and research, women were pushed out right at the start. The men were like, âOh, women are lesser beings than us. They have smaller brains.â Even Darwin said that women werenât as smart because they have smaller brains. So when you think about scientific method and how it all started, who were the people in the room? It was all men. No one really questioned the lack of women being studied. They just assumed women were smaller versions of men, so whatever works for men works for women. Tradition is really hard to change.
     
            One thing the Covid-19 pandemic did do that I appreciate is cause researchers to sit up and say, âHoly sh*t, we really need to look at sex differences.â Because Covid-19 was more severe in men, yet side effects of the vaccine were more prominent in women. Also, long Covid has hit women more severely and has affected their brain more than men. Thatâs why weâre seeing all of this sex-specific stuff coming out thatâs really good science instead of just generalized.
     
            CNN: What are some basic things all women should be doing when it comes to exercise?
     
            Sims: Any movement is good, but itâs more important that women put in strength or resistance training. Itâs more for brain health. If we look at resistance training and the neural pathways it creates, weâre seeing it really does help attenuate dementia and Alzheimerâs â and there is a sex difference there as well. Historically, though, women havenât been directed into doing resistance training. But across the board, from young to old, women should be doing strength training.
     
            CNN: Does strength training have other impacts as women approach menopause?
     
            Sims: Yes. When our hormones start changing between 40 and 50, it has a massive impact on our body composition. We start losing muscle and putting on more body fat. But if we have that lean mass from strength training, it really helps calm down that rate of change. Strength training also helps protect our bones and helps us keep our balance and proprioception (the awareness of where our body is in space). We donât see these kind of changes in men until theyâre in their late 50s to 70s.
     
            CNN: What about exercise differences between the sexes when it comes to cardiovascular work?
     
            Sims: Men can pretty much get away with everything. Women already have the capability of going long and slow, so we donât need to do that kind of exercise â our bodies are already there. What we do need to do is high-intensity work: those true high-intensity intervals of 30 seconds or one minute. This helps women raise their metabolic rate, it helps reduce visceral (deep belly) fat and, most importantly, it helps keep our gut microbiome diverse and helps improve cardiovascular health. So when we look at all the research on high-intensity versus moderate-intensity versus low-intensity workouts, we really need to push the emphasis for that high-intensity work, plus resistance training.
     
            CNN: Do women recover from exercise the same as men?
     
            Sims: Right after exercise, there is a blood pressure difference. Women will experience vasodilation, so all their blood will go to the periphery, whereas men will have vasoconstriction, which means all of their blood comes back to their heart and can be pumped a lot faster for a quicker recovery. So women tend to get lightheaded and feel a little dizzy after a hard session, because all of their blood is pooling out. Drinking something cold right after exercise helps bring that blood back centrally, reduces metabolites and starts the reparation process.
     
            CNN: What about nutritional differences between the sexes?
     
            Sims: There is a big conversation around protein intake and how the recommended daily allowance for women is really low. Itâs also based on cadaver work on 70- to 80-year-old men. So while protein is important for both sexes, we need to emphasize it for women â and especially as we age, since women become more anabolically resistant to exercise and protein intake, which means their bodies donât respond as well to exercise and protein intake to build muscle. So it takes more protein, post-exercise, and higher loads or more volume of resistance training to get muscle protein synthesis.
     
            In general, women should have 1 to 1.1 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day. If youâre doing strength training, have 15 grams of protein before a session and 30 to 35 grams after, which helps with strength and facilitating reparation. For cardiovascular work, have 15 grams of protein with 30 grams of carbohydrates before â the carbs help bring your blood sugar up, because womenâs bodies go through blood sugar quickly â but afterward is when you need protein â 30 to 35 grams, or 40 grams for perimenopausal and early post-menopausal women.
     
            CNN: There has been a lot publicized recently about the benefits of intermittent fasting, training in Zone 2 â long and slow â and other fads. Are these equally beneficial to men and women?
     
            Sims: Most of the trends out there are great for men, but itâs a different story for women. My voice is always, âLetâs show why what weâre seeing for the general population is not appropriate for women, but also, what is appropriate for women?â Because no oneâs used to pausing and saying, âOK, I heard this. But what was the population it was studied on? If it was studied on men, it might not be great for me as a woman. Well, what is appropriate for me?â Itâs too many steps.

            Sims: Any movement is good, but itâs more important that women put in strength or resistance training. Itâs more for brain health. If we look at resistance training and the neural pathways it creates, weâre seeing it really does help attenuate dementia and Alzheimerâs â and there is a sex difference there as well. Historically, though, women havenât been directed into doing resistance training. But across the board, from young to old, women should be doing strength training.
     
            CNN: Does strength training have other impacts as women approach menopause?
     
            Sims: Yes. When our hormones start changing between 40 and 50, it has a massive impact on our body composition. We start losing muscle and putting on more body fat. But if we have that lean mass from strength training, it really helps calm down that rate of change. Strength training also helps protect our bones and helps us keep our balance and proprioception (the awareness of where our body is in space). We donât see these kind of changes in men until theyâre in their late 50s to 70s.
     
            CNN: What about exercise differences between the sexes when it comes to cardiovascular work?
     
            Sims: Men can pretty much get away with everything. Women already have the capability of going long and slow, so we donât need to do that kind of exercise â our bodies are already there. What we do need to do is high-intensity work: those true high-intensity intervals of 30 seconds or one minute. This helps women raise their metabolic rate, it helps reduce visceral (deep belly) fat and, most importantly, it helps keep our gut microbiome diverse and helps improve cardiovascular health. So when we look at all the research on high-intensity versus moderate-intensity versus low-intensity workouts, we really need to push the emphasis for that high-intensity work, plus resistance training.
     
            CNN: Do women recover from exercise the same as men?
     
            Sims: Right after exercise, there is a blood pressure difference. Women will experience vasodilation, so all their blood will go to the periphery, whereas men will have vasoconstriction, which means all of their blood comes back to their heart and can be pumped a lot faster for a quicker recovery. So women tend to get lightheaded and feel a little dizzy after a hard session, because all of their blood is pooling out. Drinking something cold right after exercise helps bring that blood back centrally, reduces metabolites and starts the reparation process.
     
            CNN: What about nutritional differences between the sexes?
     
            Sims: There is a big conversation around protein intake and how the recommended daily allowance for women is really low. Itâs also based on cadaver work on 70- to 80-year-old men. So while protein is important for both sexes, we need to emphasize it for women â and especially as we age, since women become more anabolically resistant to exercise and protein intake, which means their bodies donât respond as well to exercise and protein intake to build muscle. So it takes more protein, post-exercise, and higher loads or more volume of resistance training to get muscle protein synthesis.
     
            In general, women should have 1 to 1.1 grams of protein per pound of body weight per day. If youâre doing strength training, have 15 grams of protein before a session and 30 to 35 grams after, which helps with strength and facilitating reparation. For cardiovascular work, have 15 grams of protein with 30 grams of carbohydrates before â the carbs help bring your blood sugar up, because womenâs bodies go through blood sugar quickly â but afterward is when you need protein â 30 to 35 grams, or 40 grams for perimenopausal and early post-menopausal women.
     
            CNN: There has been a lot publicized recently about the benefits of intermittent fasting, training in Zone 2 â long and slow â and other fads. Are these equally beneficial to men and women?
     
            Sims: Most of the trends out there are great for men, but itâs a different story for women. My voice is always, âLetâs show why what weâre seeing for the general population is not appropriate for women, but also, what is appropriate for women?â Because no oneâs used to pausing and saying, âOK, I heard this. But what was the population it was studied on? If it was studied on men, it might not be great for me as a woman. Well, what is appropriate for me?â Itâs too many steps.

            In many countries, up to 1 in 5 new mothers experience a mood or anxiety disorder. Unfortunately, these conditions often go undiagnosed and untreated due to lack of awareness and stigma, and everyone pays the price.
     
            Today isÂ World Maternal Mental Health Day, and itâs time to recognize the importance of maternal mental health. How can you tell thatÂ ifÂ you or a loved one may need help? What types of treatments are available? What can those who are pregnant orÂ postpartum do, and how can the community around them help?
     
            To find out more, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr. Leana Wen. Wen, a mother of two young kids, is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at the George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimoreâs health commissioner and as chair of Behavioral Health Systems Baltimore, a regional nonprofit advancing mental health and substance use disorder treatment.
     
            CNN:Â Why is addressing maternal mental health so important?
     
            Dr.Â Leana Wen:Â Mental health is an essential part of overall health. By itself, mental health influences well-being and has a major impact on the physical health of both the woman and her baby.
     
            Pregnant women with untreated mental health conditions have aÂ higher rateÂ of missing prenatal care. They are more likely to have depression, anxiety, psychosis and other mental health illnesses after delivery. Untreated mental health conditions also areÂ associatedÂ with premature birth, low birth weight babies, sleeping and feeding troubles for the baby, as well as developmental and cognitive problems.
     
            Sadly, in the United States, mental health disorders are an underlying cause of mortality in many deaths occurring during and after pregnancy. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,Â 22.7%Â of pregnancy-related deaths were associated with a mental health condition â even more than hemorrhage (13.7%) or infection (9.2%). This is a crisis, and much more needs to be done to address it.
     
            CNN: How common are maternal mental health conditions?
     
            Wen:Â Ten percent of pregnant women and 13% of women in the postpartum period experience a mental health condition, the most common of which is depression, according to theÂ World Health Organization. In developed countries, including theÂ United States, the numbers go up to more than 15% during pregnancy and 19.8%Â after childbirth.
     
            These numbers are staggering. Equally upsetting are the numbers that pertain to the lack of treatment. Some studies indicate thatÂ less than 15%Â of individuals with these conditions receive any treatment.
     
            Imagine if were discussing any other serious medical condition. Imagine if less than 15% of people with diabetes received care for it, or if less than 15% of people with heart problems got treatment. We would not find those numbers acceptable, nor should we with treatment of mental health conditions.
     
            CNN: A lot of postpartum women have âbaby blues.â How do you distinguish between that and postpartum depression?
     
            Wen:Â The âbaby bluesâ are symptoms that most women experience after birth. They include experiencing mood swings, feeling overwhelmed, being irritable and having trouble sleeping. Generally, the baby blues occur shortly after delivery and last for days. The person has some symptoms of low mood but overall is feeling well.
     
            The baby blues are quite different from postpartum depression. The symptoms of postpartum depression may initially resemble those of baby blues, but they are more intense and last longer â for at least two weeks and even months. Specific symptoms include continuous depressed mood, crying, overwhelming tiredness, and intense irritability and anger.
     
            The woman may withdraw from family and friends, have less interest in activities she used to enjoy, and even experience difficulty bonding with or caring for the baby. The person may feel hopeless, worthless, and ashamed of not being a good mother. This could progress to the mother having severe anxiety and panic attacks and thoughts of harming themselves, their babies or others around them.
     
            CNN: Are there other postpartum mental health conditions?
     
            Wen:Â Yes. Postpartum depression is the most common of the mental health conditions, but there are others.
     
            Another condition that can occur by itself or alongside postpartum depression is postpartum anxiety. Itâs normal to feel anxious after becoming a new parent, but it becomes a problem when anxious feelings are out of control and take over oneâs thoughts. Individuals with this condition have all-consuming worry, including with irrational fears about events that are unlikely to happen.
     
            Other mental health conditions, like obsessive-compulsive disorder, also known as OCD, can manifest in the postpartum period. In addition, substance use is often associated with mental health diagnoses.
     
            One more condition I want to mention isÂ postpartum psychosis. This is the most severe form of postpartum psychiatric conditions. It is rare, occurring in approximately 1 to 2 per 1,000 women in the postpartum period. Women may become erratic and shift between depression and elation, and they can have hallucinations and delusions. This is a psychiatric emergency thatÂ requires immediate careÂ to prevent the woman from harming herself, her baby and others.
     
            CNN: What kinds of treatments are available?
     
            Wen:Â Here is the good news. A variety of effective treatments are available to treat postpartum depression and other mental health disorders.
     
            The two types of treatments are talk therapy and medications. Psychotherapy involves talking through concerns with a mental health professional. There are different types of psychotherapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy. In general, they help patients to recognize and better cope with their feelings.
     
            Health care providers also may prescribe antidepressant medications. Sometimes, a doctor will add an additional medication depending on symptoms. For instance, people with anxiety may benefit also from an antianxiety medication.
     
            The US Food and Drug Administration has approvedÂ two medicationsÂ that specifically treat postpartum depression. These drugs are used for shorter periods than antidepressants and could be a good option for some women, though insurance coverage and cost could be a barrier.
     
            Just like any other medical condition, some women may respond better to one form of treatment than others. Some may need a combination of treatments. The length of treatment will also depend on individual circumstances.
     
            CNN:Â What can pregnant and postpartum women do? And how can those around them help to improve their mental health and emotional well-being?Â 
     
            Wen:Â Good health during and after pregnancy starts well before pregnancy and giving birth. Itâs crucial for women â and everyone â to seek assistance for mental health conditions. Those with preexisting mental health conditions such as depression and bipolar disorder have a much higher rate of experiencing mental health issues in the postpartum period. It is important to diagnose and treat these conditions before pregnancy.
     
            That said, itâs also very important to recognize that postpartum depression and other mental health diagnoses in pregnancy and postpartum can occur in people who have not had mental health conditions in the past. They could occur in anyone. Just as itâs not anyoneâs âfaultâ if they are diagnosed with diabetes or cancer, it is not someoneâs âfaultâ if they have a mental health condition. There should be no stigma associated with the diagnosis.
     
            People around the individual can help by being on the lookout for signs of postpartum depression. They can provide support, including encouraging treatment and offering childcare and other assistance that the person may need. Everyone should keep in mind that prompt treatment is effective and crucial to the well-being of the woman and her family.

            Brianna Starr, 29, and her sister, Alicia, 26, never worried much about sunscreen. While growing up in Kansas, they focused on getting a gorgeous tan, like many of their friends and the influencers they followed on social media.
     
            âIt was a social thing,â Brianna said. âSo many times weâd go over to my friendâs pool, and we would just lay there for two hours without any sunscreen. We used tanning beds before prom to get color. Having the appearance of being tanned was our priority.â
     
            When Alicia was diagnosed with melanoma at age 19, however, that view changed.
     
            âWhen Alicia found out she started googling and thought she would be dead in five years,â Brianna said. âLuckily, the doctors did a wide, local excision and got it all out.
     
            âI started seeing a dermatologist every six months and actually flagged two separate moles, one on my neck and one on my shoulder, that were worrisome and could have developed into melanoma,â Brianna added.
     
            Despite near constant warnings about the dangers of skin cancer and early aging, nearly a third (32%) of American adults under 35 believe a golden tan makes people look healthier, according to a survey released Wednesday by theÂ Orlando Health Cancer Institute.
     
            In fact, nearly a quarter (23%) of younger adults in the survey said drinking water and staying hydrated prevents a sunburn, and 1 in 7 (14%) of those under 35 said daily sunscreen use is more harmful to the skin than direct sun exposure, the survey found.
     
            âI think a lot of people get their information from TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, that might not be actually legit,â said Brianna, who now lives in Orlando, Florida.
     
            There is no such thing as a healthy tan, and no scientific data exists that says drinking water provides any level of protection from the sun, said Dr Rajesh Nair, an oncology surgeon at the Orlando Health Cancer Institute who led the research.
     
            âAs for sunscreens, the protective benefits far outweigh any known risks, but if youâre concerned about chemicals or ingredients in a sunscreen, mineral sunscreens like zinc oxide that offer a physical barrier to the sun are proven to be safe,â Nair said in a statement.
     
            Enter the Environmental Working Groupâs 2024 Guide to Sunscreens, also released Wednesday, which analyzed the ingredients in 1,700 chemical and mineral sunscreens and found only 1 in 4 met their standards for safety.
     
            The annual report provides a database of products by brand and type, while also breaking them down into the top recreational sunscreens, the best daily SPF (sun protection factor) and the safest sunscreens for babies and children.
     
            Many of the safest choices will be mineral-based instead of chemical-based sunscreens, said EmilyÂ Spilman, EWGâs healthy living science program manager.
     
            âThe mineral sunscreens zinc oxide and titanium dioxide are not absorbed by the skin, and they donât appear to harm the environment,â Spilman said.
     
            Mineral sunscreens work by physically deflecting and blocking the sunâs rays, as opposed to sunscreens with chemicals that absorb UV rays and release heat as they break down.
     
            The report also offers an expanded list of EWG-verified products. To be in this category, sunscreen labels must not use marketing claims banned by the FDA, such as âsunblock,â âsweatproofâ or âwaterproofâ and cannot be in an aerosol or powder form due to the risk of inhalation. The product must also have an SPF between 15 and 50 and must agree to provide results on UVA performance from an independent laboratory.
     
            One of the key changes in 2024 is the growth of US purchases of imported sunscreens from Japan and Europe where newer, safer types of sunscreen ingredients have been in use for years. Some products, sold on Amazon, Temu and other online marketplaces, boast sales of over 20,000 units each month, the report said.
     
            âThis shows that US consumers are aware that US sunscreen products donât have the same safety, efficacy and protection compared to products available in the rest of the world,â Spilman said.
     
            Thereâs one big problem, however: Itâs currently illegal to buy or sell these products in the US because they contain ingredients that have not yet been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.
     
            âItâs still not legal to bring (international sunscreens) into the US,â Spilman said. âIf youâre buying them on vacation and bringing them in through customs on your way home, there is a chance that they may be confiscated.â
     
            The FDA has been working on updating sunscreen standards for decades. The agencyâs efforts began in theÂ late 1990s, âwhen Bill Clinton was president and people worried that computer systems would fail due to the Y2K bug,â the report said.
     
            In 2021, the FDA proposed an update of sunscreen safety standards that would accelerate sunscreen safety by improving protection against ultraviolet A (UVA) rays; by mandating more transparent labels, so that it would be easier to see ingredients; and by limiting sunscreen to below 60 SPF, a level experts say provides no additional sun protection and offers false hope to consumers.
     
            The FDA also called for additional tests for aerosol products, considered by EWG and other experts to be harmful to airways as well as not as effective as sunscreen lotions.
     
            The new regulations required sunscreen manufacturers to provide more safety data on a dozen frequently used chemicals with safety concerns or take them off the market, the report said.
     
            âThe public record does not currently contain sufficient data to support positive GRASE determinations for cinoxate, dioxybenzone, ensulizole, homosalate, meradimate, octinoxate, octisalate, octocrylene, padimate O, sulisobenzone, oxybenzone, or avobenzone,â theÂ FDA stated in 2021.Â GRASE means âgenerally recognized as safe and effective.â
     
            However, deadlines given by the FDA to industry to provide that scientific information in 2022, 2023 and 2024 have come and gone with no action yet taken, said Homer Swei, EWGâs senior vice president of healthy living science.
     
            âThe FDA has reached out many times and have been very clear on the data they require, and the deadline for the industry,â Swei said. âThe FDA is going to have to make some very hard decisions on what to do here.â
     
            The Personal Care Products Council, a trade group representing the cosmetics and personal care products industry, challenged the EWGâs sunscreen guide in a written statement, saying that the report âmisleads consumers into assuming sunscreen products are unsafe, thereby jeopardizing public health.â
     
            The council and its member companies âcontinue to work with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to provide additional safety data on several ultraviolet (UV) filters in order to ensure consumer confidence in the safety and effectiveness of these critical products.â
     
            The council also noted that âglobally approved filters used in Europe and other regions are not available in the U.S., greatly limiting options for American consumers.â
     
            Some small changes have occurred: Manufacturer use of the ultraviolet ray blocker oxybenzone, which has been linked to human health harms andÂ destruction of coral reefs,Â has been in decline over the last five years, the report found.
     
            In 2019, oxybenzone was an ingredient inÂ 60% of all sunscreen products tested by EWG, dropping to 30% in 2022. By 2023 and again in 2024, the chemical was used in only 6% of tested products, which included sunscreens and daily moisturizers and lip balms with sunscreen protection.
     
            âLast year was really the first year we identified that big drop, which indicated that manufacturers and formulators were starting to move away from the ingredient, even without FDA intervention,â Spilman said.
     
            âNo new products are coming onto the market with oxybenzone in the formulation in 2024, but what weâre seeing instead is a substitution with chemicals that can all be absorbed into the skin and may be disruptive to the bodyâs endocrine (hormonal) system.â
     
            Despite these concerns, the use of sunscreen is critical to skin health, experts say, and consumers should continue to use sunscreen every day, even on cloudy days. Besides, consumers should always rely on safe sun practices first, then apply sunscreen, according to Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, former interim chief medical and scientific officer and deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.
     
            We have a phrase weâve used for a long time that actually came out of Australia:Â Slip, slop, slap and wrap,â Lichtenfeld told CNN in a prior interview.
     
            âSlip on a long-sleeve shirt, slap on a wide-brimmed hat, slop on the sunscreen, and use UV-protective sunglasses that wrap around the eyes when out in the sun,â Lichtenfeld said. âThere are a number of sun safety strategies that are effective. Sunscreens are one of those strategies, but they should not be the primary strategy.â

            Aimee Nezhukumatathil is not one to sugarcoat the past.
     
            Take vanilla, for example â that heady, aromatic stem taking you back to sickly sweet childrenâs birthday cake or that scented lotion you had as a teen. But Nezhukumatathil writes about baking with her young son, creating vanilla extract with vodka to give as gifts, carefully scraping the seeds out of their pod with the dull side of a knife. The essay â one of 40 in her new book, âBite by Biteâ â isnât just about her son, or vanilla. Itâs also about Edmond Albios, an enslaved boy who discovered a new way to pollinate the vanilla orchids in a way that changed the vanilla industry. Vanilla is the vehicle through which her parallels are drawn.
     
            âBite by Bite,â out on April 30, is poet Nezhukumatathilâs seventh book. Itâs her second of prose, following the success of 2020âs âWorld of Wonders.â And, most notably, itâs her love letter to food. Each chapter of âBite by Biteâ focuses on a food â everything from apples to butter to the Filipino dessert halo-halo.
     
            But these chapters, these essays, are not recited histories of ingredients or dishes. Instead, Nezhukumatathil weaves a personal memoir through food. In the chapter âTomato,â she writes about her mother and grandmother â juxtaposing the path of the tomato from Spain to the Philippines and from Portugal to India with her own ancestry. âLycheeâ is an ode to her Asian American writer community in New York. âShave Iceâ eulogizes female friendship.
     
            âI wanted to celebrate how delicious a full life could be,â Nezhukumatathil told CNN in a recent interview.
     
            But, like with vanilla, that deliciousness doesnât always mean sweet. There are sad tales here, too, dark histories underlying warm memories. Nezhukumatathil doesnât waver. Food can be a map toward home, toward memory, toward lineage, her book argues. And with it, she beckons us to explore.
     
            CNNâs conversation with Nezhukumatathil has been edited for length and clarity.
     
            So much of your writing brings the delights and oddities of nature to the forefront, but what made you turn your microscope to food specifically?
     
            The majority of it (the book) was written in 2021, so although I did start a few essays before the pandemic, most of it was after the pandemic.
     
            I think after a time of being so separate, and having leaders who want to divide us so much, I wanted to focus on what nourishes us and also what can bring us back together. And for me, that was food.
     
            One of the things I missed so much, I think so many people did, is being able to sit with our families, our loved ones around the table. Thereâs so many books that are the search for home.
     
            This is a search for what kinds of homes we can make with food. Thereâs chosen family, thereâs family, and thereâs our birth family, and all of our friends and everything in between. Our crushes and our exes, and all of that. But food is one big connector, so I really wanted to focus in on that.
     
            Yeah, this topic gets talked about a lot â how food can hold memory or be a cultural tie. But you talk about the origins of food â not just food as a connector between me and somebody else, but foodsâ own history, like, the etymology of cinnamon or the origins of the Concord grape. How did you go about researching and thinking about food in that way?
     
            The simple answer is Iâm just a giant nerd. So many of these things I actually modeled from my parents. Since I was a little kid, I would always watch them asking questions of the grocery store or the different markets we were at â farmers markets and things like that. I would watch how they garden. They also had vast knowledges of mangoes, of course, for both of their countries, India and the Philippines. So they always modeled the sense of curiosity for me.
     
            It wasnât like I sit down and say, âI will research the origin of sugar,â but rather I cannot eat sugarcane without what little I was taught about the horrors of the sugarcane trade as a global history. We have a little Christmas Eve tradition in my family about sugar cane. I couldnât write about that and ignore the not so great origin stories of some of these ingredients and vegetables and fruits and meals.
     
            What I wanted was to make you slow down and think about what are the stories that connect, and I think that learning that way of thinking about your own life becomes contagious. Like hey, I thought I knew apples but did you know this or did you make this connection, and maybe my story of eating a gyro sandwich might make you think of a time when you missed one of your parents or guardians, things like that. My hope is that curiosity becomes contagious for you as well.
     
            You mention eating a gyro sandwich. While I was reading, I had expected natural ingredients. Weâre going to talk about fruit, weâre going to talk about vegetables. I was really surprised at some of the inclusions of lumpia and gyros and risotto and flan and all of these other things that you also talk about. What made you incorporate those elements alongside the more raw ingredients?
     
            Itâs so funny that you mentioned that, because that was a source of much distress for me. When I was thinking about it, and just looking at my home library, my local library, at bookstores â almost every food book is like, hereâs a book on desserts. Hereâs a book of vegetables, or hereâs snacks. Hereâs a book all on chocolate. I didnât want to write anything first of all that was like anything else that was on the bookshelf.
     
            The Table of Contents came about because I was thinking of instances in my life when I felt connected to people, and so I was thinking of scenes first and food second in some ways. Because I wanted to have that overall. I wanted to start and end this book with love.
     
            It was more of like, the feeling and the scenes were important to me, and then I had to go back and say like, âOkay, what fruit encompasses this?â âWhat food encompasses this feeling?â What was going on in the scene that made me feel so welcome, or not welcome, you know? Or uncomfortable, a little bit. I was really concerned about the emotion and location of what was going on rather than, I have to make a nice, neat, orderly Table of Contents of all sweet things, or all vegetables and just vegetables. I didnât want it to be like a memoir in vegetables. So although Iâm sure that book exists somewhere, it just wasnât for me, you know?
     
            Right. But you also highlight some of the darker origins of some of these ingredients, like, in the âVanillaâ chapter, the enslaved child discovering how to pollinate vanilla orchids. Was that something you always intended to do?
     
            I read a lot for this book. And I definitely, in the back, included all the books that I was looking at. I did not know that I really was going to be writing about vanilla and my son, and it was absolute coincidence that I came across like oh the person that made vanilla what it is, was a young boy too.
     
            I really wanted to kind of celebrate, again what nourishes us, what brings us together. And part of that is facing some not-so-great moments of the past as well. I just wanted to be as honest as possible. And yet I didnât want to linger on that kind of past I wanted to, again, have each essay begin and end with a note of love.
     
            Is there anything about your own relationship with a certain food that you didnât think about before that you discovered while you were writing?
     
            I wanted to collect a gathering of essays that showcase different facets of being who I am on the cusp of 50. I wanted to celebrate childhood. I wanted to celebrate the exuberance and the exhilaration of meeting my girlfriends downtown in New York City when I was single, and happy. I also didnât want it to be like, oh, a man rescued me.
     
            Yet, thereâs also been kind of a lot of books about how terrible some men are in marriage, and also like, kids are encroaching on me being an artist. Thatâs definitely some peopleâs experiences for sure. And I donât want to negate that. But for this book, I wanted to showcase in particular for women of color, there are other ways of making it through. You do not need to have a dramatic fight. You do not need to have a jerk of a husband. You can actually like spending time with your kids and like spending time with your husband and also really enjoy your chosen family as well. You know what I mean?
     
            Thereâs different food books that showcase, âLook at me finding myselfâ or âlook at me now that I have a family.â Or, like âIâm a mom,â âlook at me now that Iâm newly divorced.â I wanted to celebrate all of it.
     
            Yeah, thereâs that trope of diaspora poetry and the trauma in that â not to say those things are not valid, but in your work you almost invite the reader into your world and into your family in a way you donât see, particularly in writing.Â 
     
            We are not the perfect family, I make plenty of mistakes and mess up a lot. But what it comes down to is that I like spending time with my family. I truly do and, and I also love spending time teaching. You donât have to choose one or the other.
     
            Sometimes I am kind of a hot mess, and other times, itâs like, Hey, weâre gonna do takeout because mama has a deadline or dad has a deadline. But I think itâs also really important for people to see possibility. To see, hey, thereâs another narrative out there of how to live rather than kind of these tired tropes that we see like, âIâm desperately embarrassed of my food, but now, Iâm notâ you know, itâs just a work in progress.
     
            You include some writing food prompts at the end of the book. What spurred you to do that?
     
            One thing that occurred during really all of my books, but in particular with the last one âWorld of Wonders,â is that so many people â and I donât know if itâs because it was released during the pandemic or what â but so many people let their guard down and were a little bit more vulnerable with me in book signing lines, in zoos, in just straight up email and letters to me, saying how much they wanted to get back to writing. Or they used to write, but they didnât know where to begin, they donât have time.
     
            I just recently taught a class in San Antonio where there were two young mothers and I could hear the kind of the pain and nervousness in their voice, I get choked up thinking about it, saying like, âI donât know who I am anymore. I used to be so creative, and I donât know what to do. But your book makes me want to do something,â you know, that kind of thing.
     
            And so I just I wanted to help all those hundreds and hundreds of people who have asked me like, I donât know where to begin to write. So I designed these over 20 years of teaching at the college level and elementary school level, and grad students and senior citizens in high school. I compiled a selection of writing prompts to get â hopefully at least one of them, but hopefully all of them â your imagination going and get you to slow down and contemplate your life and your relationship to food.
     
            You donât have to publish them. You can but you can just write in a journal and nobody needs to see it. But there is a way to help those folks who wanted a place to start and it seems overwhelming. And Iâm here to say itâs not; to start small with these prompts.

            Even if your genetics put you at greater risk for early death, a healthy lifestyle could help you significantly combat it, according to a new study.
     
            That risk could be mitigated by about 62% in people with a genetic predisposition, said lead author Dr. Xue Li, dean of the School of Public Health at Zhejian Univeristy School of Medicine in China.
     
            Many studies have shown the connection between a healthy lifestyle and longevity and others have underscored the genetic component in lifespan, but the report published Monday in the journal BMJ Evidence Based Medicine explored how the two come together.
     
            With data from more than 350,000 people and information on their genetics, education, socioeconomic status and disease history, this study had strong methodology, said Dr. Aladdin Shadyab, associate professor of public health and medicine at University of California San Diego. He was not involved in the research.
     
            The sample was made up of people with European ancestry so it is limited in the populations to which it can be applied, Shadyab added.
     
            The researchers gave each individual a polygenetic risk score, which is a score summarizing the presence of multiple genes found to impact human lifespan, according to the study. The study participants also received a score based on how they adhered to healthy lifestyle tenets, and then were followed for an average of 13 years to see if they had a short, intermediate or long lifespan.
     
            Everyone, regardless of their genetic risks, were 78% more likely to die early if they had an unhealthy lifestyle, the data showed.
     
            And people with both a genetic risk for a short lifespan and an unhealthy lifestyle were twice as likely to die early as those without genetic risk and healthier lifestyles, said Li, who is also director of National Institute for Data Science in Health and Medicine of Zhejiang University.
     
            Individuals with genetic risk could extend their lifespan by up to 5.5 years with a healthy lifestyle, the data showed.
     
            âAdherence to a healthy lifestyle could substantially attenuate the lifespan reduction for individuals with genetic susceptibility to a shorter lifespan,â Li said.
     
            The study was observational, meaning that it could determine associations but could not say for sure that the behaviors were the direct cause of the changes in lifespan.
     
            But researchers were able to identify four factors that were associated with the biggest impact on risk of early death.
     
            âThe study identified an optimal lifestyle combination containing four lifestyle factors â no current smoking, regular physical activity, adequate sleep duration, and a healthy diet â that offered better benefits for prolonging human lifespan,â Li said.
     
            Adequate sleep was defined in the study as seven to eight hours a night. The current Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity and two days of strength training a week for adults.
     
            Moderate drinking in the US is defined as a limit of two drinks in a day for adult men and one drink in a day for adult women, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
     
            Building a healthier lifestyle may sound like a major undertaking, but manageable steps can help you get there.
     
            There are phone helplines, apps and support groups that can help you quit smoking.
     
            A CDC funded tobacco cessation hotline, 1-800-QUIT-NOW (784-8669), is free to US residents in all states, plus the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico.
     
            Committing to alcohol-free days or even challenges such as Dry January or Sober October can help you reassess your relationship with alcohol and reset your habits around it, journalist Rosamund Dean, author of âMindful Drinking: How Cutting Down Can Change Your Life,â said in a previous CNN article.
     
            For a healthier, longer life, many studies have shown support for the Mediterranean diet, a style of eating that focuses on plant-based cooking heavy on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, seeds and olive oil. Red meat is used sparingly.
     
            When it comes to catching enough zâs, if you canât seem to get those seven or eight hours of sleep, try establishing a sleep routine, getting out of bed when you canât sleep, and keeping the bedroom cool, dark and free of electronics.
     
            And if youâve tried and failed to build an exercise routine you can stick to, make it a part of your everyday routine, starting slowly and choosing an activity you enjoy to get your exercise.

            A 38-year-old man repeatedly tries to force his wife to have sex in the middle of the night but has no memory of his actions when he wakes up.
     
            A married woman in her mid-20s often tears off her clothing and masturbates but remembers nothing when her partner rouses her.
     
            For a dozen years, a 31-year-old man masturbates while asleep, at times injuring his groin. Embarrassed due to his unconscious behavior, he avoids relationships for eight years.
     
            These are all clinically documented cases of sleep sex, or sexsomnia, part of a family of sleep disorders called parasomnias that include sleepwalking, sleep talking, sleep eating and sleep terrors.
     
            While it may seem as if people are acting out dreams, many parasomnias occur when the brain is not in a dream state, said Dr. Carlos Schenck, a professor and senior staff psychiatrist at the Hennepin County Medical Center at the University of Minnesota.
     
            âThese are disorders of arousal,â said Schenck, who has studied parasomnias for decades. âThey most often occur during the slowest, deepest stage of sleep, called delta sleep. Itâs like an alarm or trigger goes off in the central nervous system, and you go from your basement to your roof in no time flat.
     
            âYour cognition is deeply asleep, and youâre not with the program, but your body is activated,â Schenck said. âThatâs dangerous because then you start walking and running and doing all sorts of things without your mind being awake.â
     
            Itâs difficult to study sexsomnia, because unless people injure themselves many have no idea of their unconscious sexual activity until a bed partner tells them about it.
     
            A 2010 study quizzed 1,000 randomly selected adults in Norway and found about 7% had experienced sexsomnia at least once during their lives, while nearly 3% were currently living with the condition.
     
            âThere are some people who will engage in sexual activity with their partner, and itâs not bothersome to either one of them. So it is possible that this could be consensual for some,â said Jennifer Mundt, assistant professor of sleep medicine, psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern Universityâs Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.
     
            âThere are definitely instances where itâs alarming to the partner and to the person whoâs doing it once they realize what theyâve done.â
     
            The episodes first began in 2005, according to one womanâs husband. About twice a month his wife would moan sexually and engage in âdirty talk,â words she never used while awake, he told Schenck, who treated the woman and published her anonymous case in 2021.
     
            At times the woman would fondle her husband during the night, and they would engage in sex until she became conscious and accused her husband of forcing sex upon her.
     
            She also masturbated while calling out other menâs names, including that of a male coworker, leading her husband to believe she was cheating on him. However, partners should not assume people with sexsomnia are allowing a secret to escape from their subconscious, Schenck said.
     
            âThe sleeping brain is wired very differently from the waking brain,â he said. âYouâre not conscious when youâre asleep, so you canât reach any valid conclusion about so-called lying or truth-telling in your sleep.â
     
            The woman refused to believe her husbandâs descriptions of her behavior for years, finally seeking professional treatment in 2015 after her 9-year-old son heard her moaning sexually while asleep.
     
            âThat was terrible, terrible,â Schenck said. âAnd what is really disconcerting to these patients is they have total amnesia. Itâs the bed partner or family member telling them, âYou did this, why did you do that?â and then the patient says, âI donât remember anything.â So they are really embarrassed, full of shame, very apologetic and totally miserable.â
     
            At times, people have even been arrested over their behaviors. âThere certainly can be legal consequences from the sexual behaviors, particularly with minors, and also with aggressive behaviors during sleep,â Schenck said.
     
            âThereâs a whole area of sleep forensics to deal with these issues,â he said. âThey do very comprehensive evaluations, case histories, and interviews with relatives and others to sort out about whether itâs an excuse or the real thing.â
     
            Thereâs no way to predict that you will develop a parasomnia. Some people who have sleep talking or walking as children do develop sexsomnia or another parasomnia as adults, but many others do not, Schenck said.
     
            âWe donât know the ultimate cause, but there is a genetic component,â he said. âIf you have at least one first-degree family relative with a parasomnia, you are more likely to develop one. Then the more first- or second-degree relatives that have a parasomnia, the more likely the condition may persist into adulthood or reoccur.â
     
            Having obstructive sleep apnea may also be a trigger. Also called OSA, obstructive sleep apneaÂ is aÂ serious sleep maladyÂ in which breathing stops for 10 seconds to two minutes many times per hour each night. The condition mostly occurs in men, although more women are now developing it.
     
            âItâs the breath holding or apnea from the obstructive sleep apnea that triggers the arousal, typically in men, which then triggers the sexual behaviors in sleep,â Schenck said. âAfter you diagnose sleep apnea and you treat the patient, treatment not only controls the sleep apnea, it also controls the secondary sexsomnia.â
     
            There are medications such as clonazepam, a drug used for epilepsy, restless legs syndrome and panic disorder, that can successfully control unwanted sexsomnia for many but not all.
     
            Medication did not help the 41-year-old woman whom Schenck treated after her son overheard her, but quitting her high-stress job did. She began sleeping solidly for six to seven hours without any recurrence of her sexsomnia.
     
            âItâs so interesting, because a lot of people with stress become hyposexual, not interested in sex,â Schenck said. âAnd for others, itâs the other way. So thereâs no 100% absolute rule.â
     
            Medication for sexsomnia has side effects and can become habit-forming. People who donât wish to use drugs can try various behavioral approaches to control the condition, said Northwesternâs Mundt, who published a review of such treatments in September 2023.
     
            âFrom the literature and from my own experience, itâs definitely true we can reduce the symptoms dramatically or possibly eliminate the symptoms for some people,â she said. âOthers may only have a partial improvement or no improvement, and thatâs where medication might be necessary.â
     
            Education comes first, Mundt said, because many people donât understand sleep stages and how sexsomnia is different from nightmares or the acting out of vivid dreams.
     
            During the first and second stages of sleep, your body starts to decrease its rhythms. Then comes the third stage â a deep, slow-wave sleep in which the body is literally restoring itself on a cellular level. Rapid eye movement sleep, called REM, is when dreaming occurs â in this final stage the body becomes paralyzed so that you cannot act out your dreams and hurt yourself.
     
            Since each sleep cycle is roughly 90 minutes long, most adults need seven to eight hours of relatively uninterrupted slumber to achieve restorative sleep, according to theÂ US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
     
            âEducation in itself is a treatment strategy because often that really helps to reduce the personâs anxiety, and if we can reduce stress and anxiety that helps,â Mundt said.
     
            âThen I will target sleep hygiene such as reducing caffeine or alcohol, keeping a more consistent sleep schedule, keeping the bedroom cool and eliminating noise in their environment,â she said. âRelaxation techniques come next, and if we need further strategies, I might move to hypnosis.â
     
            Clinical hypnosis is nothing like the magician working his act on audience members, Mundt said. Instead, itâs encouraging a person to move into a daydreaming or trancelike state voluntarily.
     
            âItâs like youâre riding on a bus and youâre looking out the window, and youâre not even seeing whatâs in front of you because youâre so lost in thought,â she said.
     
            A trance state is clinically useful because people are more open to new ideas, suggestions and imagery such as seeing themselves sleeping calmly and peacefully through the night, she said.
     
            âIn some ways, itâs similar to having a parasomnia episode,â Mundt said. âPeople vary in how easy it is for them to get into that trance state, but it can be very, very effective.â

            Itâs long established that sleep plays a crucial role in health and well-being. Numerous studies have documented the relationship between health and the quantity and quality of peopleâs sleep. Anyone who has had a poor night of rest can attest to how they had less energy and were grumpier the next day.
     
            Some 18% of American adults take a form of medication to help them sleep, including over-the-counter pills and prescription medications, according to a 2023 US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. SomeÂ 6.3% said that they take sleep medications every day and 2.1% took medication most days.
     
            While medical treatments can help with sleep, are some forms more effective than others? Is there any danger in trying over-the-counter supplements such as melatonin? What about a recent social media sensation, âthe sleepy girl mocktailâ? What are nonpharmaceutical measures that can help with sleep? And why is it important to seek medical care for sleeplessness?
     
            To help us with these questions, I spoke with CNN wellness expert Dr.Leana Wen. Dr. Wen is an emergency physician and adjunct associate professor at George Washington University. She previously served as Baltimoreâs health commissioner.
     
            CNN: How do we know that sleep is important for your health?
     
            Dr. Leana Wen: The evidence is robust. For instance, studies have shown that people who regularly get fewer than seven hours of sleep per night have a higher prevalence of diabetes, obesity and high blood pressure, which are major risk factors for developing heart attacks and stroke. People with irregular sleep patterns also may have a higher risk for cardiovascular disease.
     
            Sleep deficiency may impact immune system functioning and increase your chance of contracting diseases. In addition, lack of sleep can impair learning, problem-solving, decision-making and controlling emotion. And daytime drowsiness can be dangerous; it increases motor vehicle accidents and work-related injuries.
     
            CNN: What kinds of medical treatments can help with sleep? 
     
            Wen: The US Food and Drug Administration has a list of medications, both prescription and over the counter, that are approved to treat sleeplessness and insomnia.
     
            Itâs important to note that many come with significant side effects, such as grogginess the next day, sleepwalking, confusion and dizziness. Some could be habit-forming and are not meant to be used long-term. Many have interactions with other medications. Anyone considering these treatments should speak with their physicians before starting them.
     
            CNN: Are over-the-counter medications safer than prescription medications?
     
            Wen: Not necessarily. For instance, some people take antihistamines like Benadryl to help them sleep. Antihistamines could cause dangerous overdoses if taken in large amounts or mixed with other drugs or alcohol. These medications also can cause sedation and impair someoneâs function the next day. All this is to say, just because something is over the counter doesnât mean that itâs safe in all instances.
     
            CNN: What about melatonin? What is it, and does it work to help with sleep?
     
            Wen: Melatonin is a hormone that the brain produces in response to darkness. It helps with regulating our circadian rhythm â our internal clock â and therefore is an important hormone for sleep.
     
            Melatonin supplements are lab-made versions of this hormone. There is some evidence that melatonin supplements can help with jet lag. They may also assist shift-workers and people who have trouble falling asleep at a normal time at night. The research is mixed as to whether the supplements are useful for people with chronic sleep problems.
     
            One issue to consider is that melatonin is a supplement and is not regulated by the FDA in the same way prescription medications are. The dose and purity can vary between brands. The same guidance applies for other supplements people may try as sleep aids. People should approach melatonin and other supplements with caution and, as with other over-the-counter drugs, discuss usage first with their primary care provider.
     
            CNN: Which medications are more effective than others?
     
            Wen: That depends on the individual. Just as with any other health condition, some people may respond best to one type of treatment and others to another.
     
            Taking a step back, I think itâs essential for everyone considering a medication for sleep to first contact their health care provider. You should have an assessment to figure out what the cause of your sleep deficiency is.
     
            Perhaps itâs a matter of simply not getting enough sleep. Thatâs different than if you are unable to fall asleep once you are in bed. In addition, some people are able to fall asleep but then awaken in the middle in the night.
     
            Your provider may evaluate other aspects of your life. Drinking alcohol, for instance, may help some people feel like they can fall asleep faster but can actually increase nighttime awakening and reduce sleep quality. Certain medications could be stimulants and could be affecting your sleep. Perhaps you have an undiagnosed medical condition, such as sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome, which is waking you up. Itâs important to get this evaluation done to find the root of the problem before starting medications.
     
            CNN: Thereâs been a lot of chatter over TikTok and other social platforms about the âthe sleepy girl mocktail.â What can you tell us about this trend and whether it is safe to try?
     
            Wen: I had not heard of this, but youâre right â it is all over the internet. This is a recipe for a half of cup of tart cherry juice mixed in with a scoop of magnesium powder, topped off with soda water or prebiotic soda.
     
            I think tart cherry juice was probably selected because it naturally contains some melatonin. Itâs a small amount, but perhaps can have some impact on promoting sleep. Magnesium is a mineral that some studies suggest can help with relaxation and sleep. The soda water or prebiotic soda is probably for taste.
     
            Iâm not sure this concoction meets an evidence-based standard for treating sleeplessness, but it seems pretty safe, as long as the products are purchased from reputable places. Some people may be responding to it because of a placebo effect, but to that, I say, why not? If it helps someone achieve better sleep, and there isnât harm, then they should keep it up.
     
            CNN: What are other nonpharmaceutical measures that can help with sleep? 
     
            Wen: This is a key question and goes back to the issue of why someone is having sleep problems. Many people struggle because they donât have enough time in bed, which is a first important component to good sleep. If the ideal sleep duration is at least seven hours a night, then try to allocate for at least eight hours in bed.
     
            Itâs best to aim to go to bed at around the same time every day, including on weekends. Avoid naps if possible. Sleep environment also matters. Itâs best to slumber in a cool, quiet and dark place. Screens interfere with sleep, so try to avoid looking at your cell phone or watching TV right before bed.
     
            Finally, there are other nonpharmaceutical measures, such as increased physical activity, yoga and acupuncture, that can help some people. Make sure to speak with your provider to diagnose any other issues and then try out different methods, in consultation with your provider, to see what works best for you.

            The US Environmental Protection Agency finalized a rule Tuesday that will end many uses of the highly toxic, cancer-causing solvent methylene chloride. The chemical will still be available for certain purposes, but with new guidelines meant to keep workers safe.
     
            Activists have been pushing for such regulations for decades, and it is one of several dangerous chemicals the Biden administration has banned or restricted just this year.
     
            Methylene chloride, which is also called dichloromethane, is a volatile industrial solvent that is most often used in commercial paint strippers. It is also used in metal degreasers, aerosols, adhesives, paint and coating products, and in the manufacturing of some pharmaceuticals, according to the EPA.
     
            There are risks for anyone who handles methylene chloride. The chemical is dangerous to humans when they breathe in its fumes, or when it comes into contact with the skin. Even a tablespoon of methylene chloride can kill, one study said.
     
            Fumes from the chemical can build up, particularly when someone is working in a small space, and can leave someone feeling dizzy or with numb limbs. At high doses, it can switch off the part of the brain that controls breathing. People can quickly become unconscious or have a heart attack and die.
     
            Long-term exposure, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says, can cause at least six types of cancer and can damage the nervous system, as well as the heart and organs such as the liver, kidneys and skin.
     
            Under the Obama administration, the EPA proposed restricting most retail and workplace uses of the chemical in paint stripping. In 2019, under the Trump administration, the EPA only banned consumer sales of paint strippers and coating removal products that used the chemical, allowing it to be used in other consumer products and in all occupational uses.
     
            At the time the 2019 restriction was passed, the EPA said it was necessary because of âacute fatalitiesâ after people were exposed to the chemical. However, most deaths happened on the job, where the Trump administrationâs EPA had set no restrictions. Between 1980 to 2018, a study found at least 85 fatalities directly related to the chemical; the majority of deaths happened at work.
     
            Without additional restrictions, about 260 million pounds of methylene chloride is still used each year in the United States, according to the EPA, and experts say in many cases there are alternative chemicals that can be used.
     
            Restrictions announced on Tuesday go much further than what the Obama and Trump administration had considered. The Trump administration had done a risk evaluation of more than 50 uses of the chemical, but only acted on the one for consumers. The EPA said the finalized rule bans the chemical in paint strippers in occupational uses, consumer use will be phased out within a year, and most industrial and commercial uses will be banned within two years.
     
            Methylene chloride will still be needed to make refrigerants, electric vehicle batteries, and for what the EPA called âcritical military and other federal uses.â Since the chemical wonât completely disappear from the workplace, the rule also comes with what Michal Ilana Freedhoff,Â assistant administrator for the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention at the EPA, called a âfirst of its kindâ strong worker chemical protection program.
     
            âSo itâs a much stronger action because it applies to the full suite of things methylene chloride is made and used for,â FreedhoffÂ said in a news conference.
     
            When methylene chloride is allowed, Freedhoff said, there will need to be some baseline assessment of how the chemical is used, and companies will be encouraged to find alternatives as much as possible and to also put in place some engineering controls to restrict its use. Companies will also need to monitor worker use, as well as provide worker training and personal protective equipment for those exposed to the chemical.
     
            The news that there were workplace protections in the rule pleased union leaders.
     
            âWe applaud the EPA for its final rule to protect all workers from unreasonable risk,â Dave McCall, the international president of the United Steelworkers, said. âOur union and the entire labor movement looks forward to working with the EPA on implementation of this rule.â
     
            Sarah Vogel, senior vice president for Healthy Communities at the Environmental Defense Fund, said that her organization will continue to work toward stronger protections for communities living near chemical production and use sites. Vogel said her organization had been disappointed that the Trump administrationâs ban on this chemical hadnât gone far enough.
     
            âTodayâs announcement of a ban on many of the workplace uses of methylene chloride based paint strippers, in addition to all the consumer uses, is long overdue,â Vogel said on the EPA news call.
     
            Wendy Hartley has been advocating for a ban since her 21-year-old son, Kevin, died after working to refinish a bathtub with the chemical while at work in 2017. She said she knew more had to be done after the incremental 2019 ban.
     
            âScience has told use for decades about the dangers of methylene chloride,â Hartley said. âWhen I spoke with assistant administrator Freedhoff I was in tears because this ban was finally going to happen.â
     
            In the 1800s, doctors initially used the chemical as an anesthetic, and after World War II, manufactures and retailers started using it widely. But from the beginning, people knew it was dangerous. Doctors eventually stopped using methylene chloride because it was difficult to get the dose right, and if they didnât, patients would die. In the US, chemical makers donât have to prove the products are safe before introducing them to the market. The burden is to show harm, rather than proving chemicals to be safe from the outset.
     
            âIt then can be challenging to have regulations keep pace with the latest science,â said Dr. Nicole Deziel, a Yale Cancer Center researcher and associate professor of epidemiology environmental health sciences at Yale School of Public Health. The Biden administration has introduced more regulations on chemicals recently, like on asbestos and PFAS in drinking water, as well as methylene chloride, but companies had already started phasing out many uses of these dangerous chemicals.
     
            âSome of these are a bit overdue,â Deziel said.
     
            The new rule from the EPA also excludes uses that are regulated elsewhere, so restrictions on methylene chloride used in the food industry, pesticides and in pharmaceuticals are beyond the scope of what the EPA can regulate, Freeholder said.
     
            Methylene chloride is used to make decaffeinated coffee and tea, for example, and those uses would not fall under this rule, the EPA said. Any additional restrictions will need to come from other agencies, such as the US Food and Drug Administration, which regulates foods and drugs.

            In the Los Angeles restaurant where Nathaly Paola Castro Torres works, customers never fail to comment on her short stature.
     
            âPeople stare at me too much and make comments or jokes,â Torres, 42, said. âMany times they also (take) photos of me and I donât like it. I feel very bad.â
     
            At 4 feet, 2 inches tall (127 centimeters), Torres is a âlittle personâ who isnât used to such reactions. While she was growing up in Quito, Ecuador, people seldom mentioned her height. She worked at a car dealership, felt embraced by her community, and considered her size an advantage.
     
            âSince I was a teenager, I saw my height as (an opportunity) to develop â the growth problem is part of my personality,â Torres told CNN in Spanish.
     
            âI am also quite lucky because in reality my body protects me a lot from diseases that other people have every day,â she added. âThis height, at the same time as being a limitation, is also a blessing.â
     
            Torres has a rare disorder called Laron syndrome that is caused by a genetic mutation. It stunts her growth but also provides a hidden silver lining: Her body is protected from chronic diseases such as cancer that often take life away long before old age.
     
            âI wonder what people who make fun of Nathaly would say if they knew she lived in a body that may some day provide information on how to live longer, disease-free lives,â said Valter Longo, professor of gerontology and biological sciences at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.
     
            âWe have shown in studies people with Laron have a very low incidence of cancer, diabetes and cognitive decline,â said Longo, who has studied Laron syndrome for nearly 20 years. âBrain scans have shown they have more youthful brains â the equivalent of someone 20 years younger. I have yet to see a case of Alzheimerâs in this population.â
     
            And according to a new study published Friday in the journal Med, Torres and other people who have the condition may also be protected from heart disease, Longo said.
     
            âIt doesnât mean that they are immune to these diseases, but people with Laron syndrome certainly seem to be very protected,â added Longo, who was a coauthor of the latest research. âThis is how powerful this mutation seems to be.â
     
            The first cases of little people who seemed to shrug off disease were identified in Israel in 1958 among children of Jewish immigrants from Yemen and other parts of the Middle East. Today, there may be between 350 and 500 people with Laron syndrome in the United States, Ecuador, Israel, Croatia, Ireland and other European countries, Longo said.
     
            In 1987, Dr. Jaime Guevara-Aguirre, then a young physician just starting his career, discovered a group of about 100 people with Laron syndrome scattered across rural towns in Ecuador. Guevara-Aguirre, who was first author of the new report, is the founder of the Institute of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Reproduction in Quito.
     
            These people all carried a mutation in their human growth hormone receptor gene, according to Guevara-Aguirreâs research. That genetic disruption blocks the bodyâs ability to use insulin-like growth factor, or IGF-1, a hormone created primarily in the liver. Growth hormone and IGF-1 work together to promote normal bone and tissue growth, so a deficit stunts growth.
     
            People with Laron have IGF-1 in their tissues, where it can be called upon to help heal wounds and other body processes. However, unlike the rest of us, these folks have little of the hormone circulating in their bloodstream, where it wreaks  havoc and contributes to aging.
     
            Fortunately, the lack of circulating IGF-1 also blocks the uncontrolled growth of cancer cells and creates an extra sensitivity to insulin that protects against diabetes.
     
            In 2005, Guevara-Aguirre reached out to Longo, who had been studying a similar mutation in yeast cells that extended their existence.
     
            âIn addition to yeast cells, worms, flies and mice with similar mutations all live extraordinarily long lives,â Longo said. âMice with the same mutation we are studying in humans hold the record in longevity â they live 40% longer than mice without it, and 50% of those mice never develop any pathology. So they are living longer and healthier lives.â
     
            The two began to collaborate, hoping they might identify a drug that could potentially be used to lower circulating IGF-1 in the general population and provide antiaging and disease-preventive benefits, Longo said.
     
            âThe idea would be for people who have high circulating IGF-1 levels to get drugs that lower the IGF-1 back to the range that seems to be associated with the lowest mortality rate, much like people take a drug for high cholesterol,â Longo said.
     
            A Western diet packed with protein and sugar also increases circulating levels of IGF-1, thus hastening aging, Longo said.
     
            âThere are IGF-1 lowering diets, such as fasting for five days a month, which is called a fasting-mimicking diet,â he said. âWe have published studies which found circulating IGF-1 levels remained depressed for a while after doing this.â
     
            Guevara-Aguirre and Longo are also looking for funding to provide IGF-1-boosting injections to children in Ecuador born with Laron syndrome. Given during childhood to encourage height, the drugs could then be stopped to allow the mutationâs genetic protection against disease to take over.
     
            âSo far, the (Ecuadorian) government and pharmaceutical companies will not pay for it,â Longo said. âWe are having to do it more slowly with diet, and we have had a bit of success.â
     
            There are health risks connected to Laron syndrome as well. The condition leads to extreme obesity, a trigger for diabetes, heart disease, cancer and other diseases. In addition, many of the people Longo studies ânever exerciseâ and often drink, smoke and reside in disadvantaged communities without adequate health care, he said.
     
            Instead of dying from chronic diseases connected to obesity, however, there is an unusually high rate of alcohol- and accident-related deaths as well as convulsive disorders among the Laron population, he said.
     
            And because low levels of IGF-1 in those without the mutation have been linked in studies with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, âeverybody assumed that people with Laron probably had a lot of heart and cardiovascular problems, too, especially considering their obesity,â he added.
     
            To find out, Longo and Guevara-Aguirre examined Torres and 23 others with Laron syndrome and compared them with 27 of their first-degree relatives without the condition, most of whom live in Ecuador.
     
            âWe found people with Laron certainly do not have an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease despite the fact that they are often obese and live in poor environments, and some markers of cardiovascular disease were even improved,â Longo said.
     
            People with Laron in the study had better insulin sensitivity, lower blood pressure and no heart rhythm disturbances â all positive outcomes, he said.
     
            In addition, people with Laron syndrome had plaque deposits in their arteries of only 7% despite having high cholesterol, which typically leads to clogging of the arteries and a higher risk of heart attacks, stroke and other heart diseases.
     
            The control group of first-degree relatives, who shared the same diet and lifestyle, had plaque deposits of 30%, Longo said.
     
            However, additional signs of cardiovascular wear and tear were absent from the study, leaving some questions unanswered, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.
     
            âStill, I think itâs an interesting and promising study,â said Freeman, who was not involved in the research. âIt lays the groundwork to see what we learn from this to reduce harms that affect people as they age.â
     
            Torres recently went to the doctor for a checkup. While technically overweight at 100 pounds (45.4 kilograms), she was in good health, with no signs of diabetes or heart disease.
     
            â(The doctor) tells me, âIf you want, you can lose weight, but itâs not a health problem for you, youâre perfect,ââ Torres said. âI feel very fortunate and find the response of my body to these other more serious diseases very interesting.â
     
            She plans to stay in the United States to take advantage of educational opportunities and to see whether she âcan get a chance for a better job, a career.â However, she said she misses her family and the ease of purchasing fresh fruits and vegetables abundant in Ecuador.
     
            âI learned is that even though my body is a little more adaptable, I still have to be careful with my diet,â she said. âBecause although it is true that we have a health advantage over other people, we do not know for sure to what extent this will protect us.â
     
            She also said sheâs proud of her role in the research on Laron syndrome.
     
            âThe objective is to be able to develop some medical help in order to help the rest of the people who struggle with diabetes and cancer, two of the most catastrophic diseases,â she said. âThis is my hope.â

            In 2005, Guevara-Aguirre reached out to Longo, who had been studying a similar mutation in yeast cells that extended their existence.
     
            âIn addition to yeast cells, worms, flies and mice with similar mutations all live extraordinarily long lives,â Longo said. âMice with the same mutation we are studying in humans hold the record in longevity â they live 40% longer than mice without it, and 50% of those mice never develop any pathology. So they are living longer and healthier lives.â
     
            The two began to collaborate, hoping they might identify a drug that could potentially be used to lower circulating IGF-1 in the general population and provide antiaging and disease-preventive benefits, Longo said.
     
            âThe idea would be for people who have high circulating IGF-1 levels to get drugs that lower the IGF-1 back to the range that seems to be associated with the lowest mortality rate, much like people take a drug for high cholesterol,â Longo said.
     
            A Western diet packed with protein and sugar also increases circulating levels of IGF-1, thus hastening aging, Longo said.
     
            âThere are IGF-1 lowering diets, such as fasting for five days a month, which is called a fasting-mimicking diet,â he said. âWe have published studies which found circulating IGF-1 levels remained depressed for a while after doing this.â
     
            Guevara-Aguirre and Longo are also looking for funding to provide IGF-1-boosting injections to children in Ecuador born with Laron syndrome. Given during childhood to encourage height, the drugs could then be stopped to allow the mutationâs genetic protection against disease to take over.
     
            âSo far, the (Ecuadorian) government and pharmaceutical companies will not pay for it,â Longo said. âWe are having to do it more slowly with diet, and we have had a bit of success.â
     
            There are health risks connected to Laron syndrome as well. The condition leads to extreme obesity, a trigger for diabetes, heart disease, cancer and other diseases. In addition, many of the people Longo studies ânever exerciseâ and often drink, smoke and reside in disadvantaged communities without adequate health care, he said.
     
            Instead of dying from chronic diseases connected to obesity, however, there is an unusually high rate of alcohol- and accident-related deaths as well as convulsive disorders among the Laron population, he said.
     
            And because low levels of IGF-1 in those without the mutation have been linked in studies with a higher risk of cardiovascular disease, âeverybody assumed that people with Laron probably had a lot of heart and cardiovascular problems, too, especially considering their obesity,â he added.
     
            To find out, Longo and Guevara-Aguirre examined Torres and 23 others with Laron syndrome and compared them with 27 of their first-degree relatives without the condition, most of whom live in Ecuador.
     
            âWe found people with Laron certainly do not have an increased incidence of cardiovascular disease despite the fact that they are often obese and live in poor environments, and some markers of cardiovascular disease were even improved,â Longo said.
     
            People with Laron in the study had better insulin sensitivity, lower blood pressure and no heart rhythm disturbances â all positive outcomes, he said.
     
            In addition, people with Laron syndrome had plaque deposits in their arteries of only 7% despite having high cholesterol, which typically leads to clogging of the arteries and a higher risk of heart attacks, stroke and other heart diseases.
     
            The control group of first-degree relatives, who shared the same diet and lifestyle, had plaque deposits of 30%, Longo said.
     
            However, additional signs of cardiovascular wear and tear were absent from the study, leaving some questions unanswered, said Dr. Andrew Freeman, director of cardiovascular prevention and wellness at National Jewish Health in Denver.
     
            âStill, I think itâs an interesting and promising study,â said Freeman, who was not involved in the research. âIt lays the groundwork to see what we learn from this to reduce harms that affect people as they age.â
     
            Torres recently went to the doctor for a checkup. While technically overweight at 100 pounds (45.4 kilograms), she was in good health, with no signs of diabetes or heart disease.
     
            â(The doctor) tells me, âIf you want, you can lose weight, but itâs not a health problem for you, youâre perfect,ââ Torres said. âI feel very fortunate and find the response of my body to these other more serious diseases very interesting.â
     
            She plans to stay in the United States to take advantage of educational opportunities and to see whether she âcan get a chance for a better job, a career.â However, she said she misses her family and the ease of purchasing fresh fruits and vegetables abundant in Ecuador.
     
            âI learned is that even though my body is a little more adaptable, I still have to be careful with my diet,â she said. âBecause although it is true that we have a health advantage over other people, we do not know for sure to what extent this will protect us.â
     
            She also said sheâs proud of her role in the research on Laron syndrome.
     
            âThe objective is to be able to develop some medical help in order to help the rest of the people who struggle with diabetes and cancer, two of the most catastrophic diseases,â she said. âThis is my hope.â
